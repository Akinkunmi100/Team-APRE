My vivo and also many android flagships offers Si/C ( silicone carbon ) batteries a more advance version of general silicon batteries found in phones with low heat dissipation, charges faster,slimmer in size,more mAh and gives more endurance overall than normal lithium ion battery.. I use my phone like a machine but still I failed to draw down my battery health in the whole day still have breath for the next days. This is nuts ðŸ˜œ Si/C ðŸ’ª. I swore and I bet X300 pro is around the corner and after that X300 ultra and inshallah will shake the market again. Samsung and iPhone days are long gone. Yes those were better until 2023 .

Selling expensive even itâ€™s useless Optimizing industrial process ( cheaper to use same board same code than make some specific board pins connectors code or whatsoever for a new phone ).

Originally asked about battery durability, but ended up arguing with AI as it could not submit sufficient detail in order for the claim ""A is better than B"". ""OnePlus phones potentially have better power consumption or batter than other Android brands, but actual efficiency depends heavily on usage scenarios such as screen brightness, app type, network conditions, gaming intensity, and background processes. Therefore, claims of general superiority in power efficiency should be made cautiously and case-by-case."" Reply",2025-09-11 00:00:00,,GSM Arena,Technical Review,676,2025-09-12 17:22:58.737811

Oh and it was even thinner at 4.8mm, even if the 5.5 inch screen meant it was larger overall than the Allview (for those wondering both also had 3.5mm ports). I genuinely do not understand why people think this Air is at all impressive, this battery size could probably be achieved in the same shell of either of these 2014 phones simply with the advancements we've had in battery technology in the last 11 years. They didn't have to resort to using the earpiece as the only loudspeaker or cramming the mainboard into the camera bump.

Galaxy A07 4G,Anonymous,"? Anonymous y6W 11 Sep 2025 I bought this phone to replace my old S20 FE as my secondary phone. Honestly, it's cheap and it shows. Cameras and speakers are par for its price segment - not something that I'd use when I go out, not even at home. I only play Pokemon Unite, and I do not like the A07's performance, lol. If you're getting this phone, it should be for the reason that you need a secondary phone. If you're buying this as a daily driver, remember this is a budget phone. If you just want something that opens your apps (socmed, fintech, online shopping) it's a good choice. What I like about it is the long software support since I just want a phone that continues to receive security updates. The battery usage is also quite good even on the first day of use. But the charging is slower than I anticipated despite me using the same charger for all my phones. Oh, it doesn't come with a wall charger, if you mind that. So for a secondary phone, it's a good deal. That means it's the phone that would only be tapped when it sounds a notification.

Speaking of which, Apple should by law be made to provide its own phone cases fitted with lanyard strap holes as standard because to make a sweep panorama sucessfully you do need to be able to use a strap around your neck stretched out with your hands holding the phone to be able to keep the phone at the same distance from you as from your subject. Further, the Ultrawide camera NEEDS image stabilization built-in for any use at all, like the main camera and the telephoto. Nobody should ever have their video image cropped and resized by electronic stabilization. As this has not changed, and as the Ultrawide module is the same as last year buying a 17 is pointless.

Galaxy XCover7 Pro,Anonymous,"A Active lifestyle use Gxt 09 Sep 2025 Initial Impressions: The Phone Itself (3/5 Stars) When I first unboxed this phone, I was excited. It was a huge upgrade from my previous XCover Pro, and for the first three weeks, it was a fantastic device. As someone with an active lifestyle, I've always prioritized rugged phones, and the initial performance and feel of this model lived up to my expectations. Durability Test: The Drop That Broke the Screen (1/5 Stars) Unfortunately, the real test came in the third week. The phone took a spill from my waist onto a concrete sidewalk. While my previous Active phones and Xcover Pro had taken similar falls without issue, the screen on this phone shattered completely. For a rugged phone with Gorilla Glass that's designed to withstand these kinds of impacts, this was extremely disappointing and not what I expected at all. The Repair Saga: A Test of Patience (0/5 Stars) My real frustrations began when I tried to get the phone repaired. The process has been a nightmare from start to finish. June 23rd: Sent the phone to Samsung. July 14th: Finally received a diagnosis and was able to pay for the screen repair, nearly three weeks later. A few days later: I was notified that parts were unavailable, causing a week-long delay. After another week: Samsung began the process to issue me a credit instead of a repair, which also took more than a week to arrive. August 7th: The e-coupon finally arrived, nearly a month and a half after I sent the phone in. September 9th (and counting): The coupon, which is only valid on the Samsung.com business site where this specific phone is sold, doesn't work. I've spent over three weeks trying to get help from customer service, but the issue remains unresolved. It is now over two and a half months since I sent my phone in, and I still don't have a working device or a functioning way to get a replacement. Final Verdict While the phone's hardware was initially impressive, the lack of durability in a real-world scenario and the absolutely frustrating and time-consuming repair process are major red flags. I cannot in good conscience recommend this product. My advice to anyone considering this phone is to save yourself the trouble and look for a more reliable company that stands by its products and its customers.

Newer gen Mali GPUs will have more cores and shaders(per core) than the last gen. Even ARM does change their architects. The issue is which GPU the SoC manufacturer uses, when there are those that offer more performance. Not everything is the same thing. With me going from A14 5G to Edge 40 Neo, Exynos 1330 to Dimensity 7030, Mali-G68 MP2 to Mali-G610 MC3, clear difference especially with games.

Moto G06 Power,Anonymous,"? Anonymous kJW 07 Sep 2025 At 18-watt charging, it will take about 1hr 55mins to charge this 7000mah battery (0-100%). Anyone constantly charging their phone from 0-100% is a fool. The battery will only last about 20 months!  Best for the battery to live between 30-80%. Simple, charge this phone for 60 minutes (50% fill up) every 1-3 days and it'll work fine. Use a Motorola 18W charger! Off brand chargers can ruin your battery quicker! ---------------------------------------------------------------- FYI: A 15-Watt charger on a 5000 mah battery, charges 1% per minute. (1hr 40mins for 0%-100%) An 18-Watt charger on a 6000 mah battery, charges 1% per minute. (1hr 40mins for 0%-100%) I have a 68W Moto charger for an Edge 2023+ with 5100mah (amazing phone by the way), I use 68W charging as little as possible (only if I forget to charge it), as it is too fast, which means too hot, which then degrades the battery quickly. I just pop a 15W charger for 30-45 minutes a day and I'm good to go. The battery will probably last over 5 years this way.

iPhone 16 Pro Max,Anonymous,"? Anonymous LYr 06 Sep 2025 4685 mAh and 17.955 Wh means voltage is around 3.8325. The maximum mAh before the 20 Wh threshold is reached at that voltage is 5218 mAh. 17 Pro Max is rumored to be around 5000, so 20 Wh could already be reached with 18 Pro Max if the capacity continues to increase. From there on, the next options are either dual cell (and in that case, I think itâ€˜s possible that Apple would give dual cell to the smaller model as well to reach and advertise faster charging speeds) or thinner+lighter design. Iâ€˜d personally appreciate thinner and lighter, but the camera capabilities of the standard model are good enough for me, so if they went with thin and light on the standard models (like they already plan to do with 17 Air, if that would expand to the 6.3 inch 18 that would be great), Iâ€˜m fine if the Pro models are thicker and heavier for extra battery runtime and charge speed. The strategy could be like with MacBook Air and MacBook Pro. The cheaper models are very thin and light, the Pro models are thicker and heavier but with better specs. It would be perfect in my option if they had a display size spread like on the MacBooks. Those have 13 and 15 on the Air and 14 and 16 on the Pro. If iPhone 18 was 6.0 and 6.6 on the standard and 6.3 and 6.9 on the Pros, there would be something for everyone. Reply",2025-09-06 00:00:00,,GSM Arena,Technical Review,1343,2025-09-12 17:22:58.737811

Moto G06 Power,Anonymous,"? Anonymous 3hg 05 Sep 2025 I remember when Moto G7 Power came out and its 5000 mAh battery was much bigger than anything else available on the market. I would never get such a heavy phone but as a one off, how about they get ahead of the other Chinese brands (BBK/Xiaomi/Huawei/Transsion), which are now at 8000 and planning for 10000, by building a phone with 11000, or even 16000 to get ahead of even the current ambitions of the other Chinese. Just this phone but with 16000 mAh and 17mm thickness and 400g to finally shush the people here asking for bigger and bigger batteries. And one variant with 11000 mAh and 12mm thickness and 300g weight. Shouldnâ€™t cost that much, and if the phone is useless it can at least be used as a power bank for a good phone.

Just because BT TWS are available everywhere doesn't mean they are better by default. â‚¬25 IEMs have way better sound quality than almost all TWS x4-x8 their price. When I want to listen to something quickly in privacy it is way faster to just slap something into 3.5 than faffing about with the BT connection ritual, and when I want to have a conversation with people I can just pull them out and let them hang instead of wagging my fingers at people and saying how I don't hear them for the five seconds it takes to turn on ambience mode. And they don't run out of charge. TWS have their own advantages over wired IEMs too, of course, but lets not pretend that they are always universally better and that having physical jacks is somehow holding something back. We all know that the real reason why 3.5 is getting removed is because it forces people to buy TWS, preferably the same brand as the phone, as that is a device that has a guaranteed expiry date because of the consumable nature of batteries.

Well, last year the Tab S10 Ultra had a Dimensity 9300+, so don't disregard it yet. How even cares about extra performance anyway when the Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 was more than adequate. And why use a laptop processor in your iPad when it's still technically running a phone OS? It's a bit of a waste if you ask me.

Or it one time only ?? no, you just need to manually make sure you turn on notifications/give all permissions to apps you need most, so that the software doesnt nuke it in the background and prevent notifications from coming in. After you do that, you'll get notifs as fast as an iPhone if not even faster, but your battery will be ~S25 Ultra levels if not a bit worse.

I loved ... more I got it almost 3 months ago Almost flawless phone Camera is so so, you can get decent pictures, video is mediocre Display, chipset , cooling , ultrasonic fingerprint are amazing Battery is exceptional. I come from xiaomi hyperos and had other phones recently. It is the first phone for me that mever had any throttling and battery drain. Games run super smooth and also recently i got an update that forced many games like cod warzone to go beyond 60fps. Believe it or not, I've never encountered any bug so far. Ui works flawlessly. Maybe its due to the chinese rom. I knew about notification delay and i had that in my phones before so that doesn't bother me anymore. There are chinese stuff here and there and some can't be changed to english and after a short time i turned off some ai stuff and that no longer gets on my nerve. The thing about redmi k80 ultra and other xiaomis is that after a long wait for optimization of hyperos and changing phones, i accepted the fact that Xiaomi is not going to solve the problem anytime soon. Overheating and battery drain were huge problems on miui 14 and hyperos 1 and 2. Reply",2025-09-02 00:00:00,,GSM Arena,Technical Review,1278,2025-09-12 17:22:58.737811

Moto G86 Power,Anonymous,"C Chris D$k 02 Sep 2025 Having already got an Edge 50 Neo, I picked up the G86 Power cheaply ($339 AUD). Its.... underwhelming. Screen is not as vibrant, when sunlight boost does work outside, colours go kind of washed out like Samsung phones do. No option to turn that off. Sunlight boost stopped working after a few hours and required a reboot, like every Moto I've ever owned. Battery seems good so far, but will need a few drains to properly see. Haptics are awful, camera is nowhere near as good as the Neo, and there is NO 4k/60, despite what this page and some reviews have said. I think i'll return it for a refund.

Reno14 F,Anonymous,"m mikezizz ucX 02 Sep 2025 After almost two months of using this phone. DO NOT BUY THIS PHONE! If you are looking for a phone with SD card slot, look elsewhere. You can barely use your SD card if its more than 100GB (mine is 366GB out of 1TB) Every seconds the phone refreshes/scans the sd card that makes any file hardly load. Even if you have fully loaded the whole sd card files/folder it will scan/refresh again after few minutes. For my case everytime i have to wait 10-15mins to access/view/load something. Few minutes later i have to wait another 10-15mins again. I CAN HARDLY LISTEN TO MUSIC AND VIEW MY PHOTOS!!! My music app have to constantly work extremely hard to access those files. I thought this thing onky happened to my old sd card (SanDisk Extreme Pro 512GB) But No! This also happen to my newly bought Samsung Sonic The Hedgehog microSDXC 1TB which i bought 2. All these SD Card works fine, in fact flawlessly on my older devices OPPO RENO 7Z, Xiaomi Mi Max and SHARP Aquos R8s Pro. Currently they have two major problems (this is after recent update) 1. Brightness going crazy when enabling disable permission monitoring drom the developer options (previously this causes massive flickering) 2. Storage performance particularly SD Card. Horrible, Horrible, Horrible. Can barely use the SD Card. Probably purposely doing this to promote Cloud Storage or to get users to buy Phone without SD card slot. Like i said, WORST PHONE in the history of mobile phones. And i feel like I'm the only human being using this phone in this world.

Having returned to Xiaomi after a few years, I initially didnâ€™t like the OS, but now that Iâ€™ve gotten used to it, the phone is excellent. I particularly love the Gallery app, as the built-in video editor allows you to create AI-generated videos. The video software is quite advanced. Iâ€™m even considering getting a Xiaomi tablet if it offers similar featuresâ€”itâ€™s fantastic for content creation. You can also extract text from photos of anything with writing on it, which really surprised me since my old Realme couldnâ€™t do this. On top of that, it includes a built-in ChatGPT-style writing assistant. Even the camera is actually quite good.

Ace 5 Ultra,Anonymous,"T TheCop bxY 31 Aug 2025 I got my hands on this beast, fresh import from China via Shopee MY, below MYR1500. At first I got to go through tons of bloatware removal as well as disabling this and that. it does look and feels like a premium device, the vibration is superb, kinda like Iphone feel. Stereo speaker got some bass on it, which is totally great for music but not quite for video with speech. 5g for both SIM (NSA) works flawlessly on YES5G and Hotlink. Only the cameras are somehow mediocre but that's fine, photos look the same nowadays. Reply",2025-08-31 00:00:00,,GSM Arena,Technical Review,553,2025-09-12 17:22:58.737811

Perhaps the price should be able to represent those weaks. 140 euros seems to be too high at this moment since transsion is recently offering cheaper price with decent specs like malfunction brake in a vehicle. To allow Xiaomi defeat transsion, they have to reduce the price about 10 euros at least. This would be a perfect move comes from Xiaomi and in sustaining its generousity.

Jealous of the 12GB RAM - it's only available in 8/128 config in Australia. Still, the phone is amazing for the price. Great camera, design, moto UI feature set. My only issue is the 7300 is a little bit sluggish and it will stutter occassionally. In any case it's the best motorola phone in this standard design (not curved screen or flip) and hopefully the processor can be improved next year. MicroSD is a lifesaver btw.

Moto G86 Power,Anonymous,"? Anonymous CbE 24 Aug 2025 I purchased this phone after considering Oppo K13, Vivo T4R and Oppo F27. My earlier device was Moto G34 which gave me stellar service for a year and was one of the reasons I opted for a Motorola phone. Main points after few days of use : 1) Excellent battery life. I am easily getting 2+ days with heavy internet use and YouTube videos. 2) Excellent bright crisp display. 3) Good cameras with ultrawide and OIS. Lack of OIS was one reason Oppo K13 was not purchased. 4) Sturdy build with IP69. The phone looks well built and much better IMO than Vivo T4R. 5) Less bloatware than Oppo K13 and Vivo T4R. Very few apps that need to be uninstalled. The other advantage is since I was already using a Moto switching over to a new device was easy from day 1 due to OS familiarity. I feel Motorola have a winner here and I expect this phone to sell well. It has most of the features needed for day to day use.

2 ho... more even tho it has all of those ""joke"" things apple always has its way like my aunt uses the base model of the iphone 13 with your JOKE hz but its crazy smooth same with the ram and even tho the battery is small it lasts almost a day with normal,heavy gaming thats a different story also wiith your JOKE price just look at the triple flip huawei even tho the specs looks good but it bugs its scratches easily only with your fingernail and its 4000 euros also wait for the iphone 17 pro max even tho it will have a JOKE price it will still be worth it trust me Reply",2025-08-24 00:00:00,,GSM Arena,Technical Review,701,2025-09-12 17:22:58.737811
Galaxy A17,Anonymous,"o oo Ruly oo txF 24 Aug 2025 It's a surprise for me to know the a1x series got OIS for the main camera. There is not much upgrade over the previous model. This is Samsung particular way to distinguish among the series. So I have no more question. It is good already. Samsung has good quality product so far compared to the ones China brand. We can't simply forget the software update which is longer than the ones again from China brand. The lasting that we should take into our mind is we will never make our money wasted from buying device out of Samsung. As an alternative you may consider product from Xiaomi if you have limited budget but still thinking to get high quality product comes with commonly lower price. The only issue is just on software update which normally shorter than Samsung. But if you the one who uses phone and replace it every 2 or 3 years, I don't see it will be a problem.

The battery is big in capacity but they sucessfully made it thinner than smaller capacity which they called it blue volt technology.

Galaxy Z Fold7,Anonymous,"L Lognid DXS 22 Aug 2025 I have had this phone now for few weeks.  There are many nice things with that phone but also some not as great. Front screen is really nice, clear an good brightness.  (just hate that underscreen camera) Big screen is nice, clear and good for reading emails, news and when having two apps open at same time. (hate underscreen camera and screen size does nothing for video) When I watch Netflix I prefer front screen as itÂ´s more clear and fits better movie size.  Also I can make phone stand like tent on table.  I donÂ´t get bigger video with tha aspect of big screen. All cameras are good.  Tried to use AI in darker area and works good but itÂ´s like use AI to create what is to dark, not real so I turn it off and pictures are still OK Fingerprint scaner in button I like, but itÂ´s not always accurate Battery seems to last ok compare to how small it is.  Cant go fully 2 days but then just charge j85% every day so itÂ´s fine. When I want to act quick and make photo, I hate that I donÂ´t have camera button to quick open camera. makes me 1 sec slower then on prevoius phone. Also I hate how much Samsung, Android uses to many Samsung apps when many Orginal Google are really good. New this before bought phone and know I donÂ´t need to use many of these Samsung. Think price on this phone is way to high, but as they give me Galaxy Buds3 Pro and Galaxy Watch Ultra with it it looked OK.  Samsung Galaxy Buds3 Pro are something I would not buy or recommend friends to buy.  Sound is nothing special, itÂ´s not hanging good enough in ear and quite away from the best in headsets like Bose and Sony so I already give it away.   This watch is mostly good, but probably they give away as itÂ´s have one big fault.  All these Samsung and Apple watches have to little time on battery, but because of some new sensors they needed to take away wirless charging option for that watch so you are always stuck with charing cable.  You canÂ´t top this watch up with your phone if itÂ´s low on battery as some other watches.  Battery last 2-3 days and takes around 2 hours to charge. Also I am not sure if I can use 2 Nano-SIM cards in mine.  think is just 1 slot, but then need eSIM.  So now I have 2 phones in pocket until I change 1 number to eSIM Reply",2025-08-22 00:00:00,,GSM Arena,Technical Review,2276,2025-09-12 17:22:58.737811

I care mostly about the battery, and ... more Oh wow, your old potato phone with a 2.2W TDP chipset outlasted a powerful 7W chipset? You know there's several throttling tests out there? The 7T throttles more than the X7 Pro, by a lot. For the 7t battery life - there's already comments here complaining about 7T lasts less than a day, on Amazon customer reviews, and on YouTube saying the same. The 7T camera gets mocked all over YouTube. It's like 0 calibration went into it. Realme already had to lower the price because no one was buying their overpriced 500â‚¬ junk.

P4 Pro,atichko,"M{V 21 Aug 2025 Not a bad looking phone with a plastic/glass fibre frame and bamboo looking back. Not unique or extremely original but nice non the less. The rest of the specs are looking good as well. I only had one Realme phone (the one that looked like a luggage case from a few years ago) but I didn't have a good experience with it. Out of the box it had different software issues. The aftercare wasn't fab either as I had to send it back, wait for more than a month (but that's probably because I bought it in the Netherlands while living in Belgium and not having an official branch for that part of Europe) and when I finally got it back the problems were not solved. Nothing was done actually as I found out that the feedback was that there wasn't anything wrong. I had to send it back and create a list of all issues that I had and try to prove it wasn't ""user related"". Only after almost two months I finally got another unit but by that time I was fed-up with the brand and sold it on immediately at a loss.

Mix Flip 2,Anonymous,"v vita Prk 16 Aug 2025 Is this really really REALLY official?? :( What I liked about Xiaomi was when it wasn't being a thirsty copycat and actually did their own thing, that was the MIX line. It's was what finally made me quit iPhones (for the most part, initially.) Xiaomi was put in the MET for F's sake, for the MIX line, that one time it was not ripping other companies' work off. I hated everything on MIUI, until I knocked loose something inside that made the screen go dark and I was forced to switch to a ""pure"" Pixel phone experience. The current Pixel experience. Oh boy, then I missed the invasive little thing like nothing else in the world, more than anything though, I missed the design. Because I might've hated it guts, but when it's wrapped in a beautiful, shiny, very f***ing slippery, ceramic shell, it kinda takes a bite out of MIUI worst traits. Can't say the same for Google's designs, they're boring, just as Google. Including Material Design and its iterations. Now that the Mix line jumped behind another car dragging empty cans on a string, whatever else is making noise, does Xiaomi has anything original? I'll just slip in a convenience denial for a bit, â€¦see if it's fixed in a few months. Reply",2025-08-16 00:00:00,,GSM Arena,Technical Review,1226,2025-09-12 17:22:58.737811

Moto G56,Anonymous,"Y Yolo n$K 16 Aug 2025 I've had the smartphone for 2 weeks. I came from Samsung J5 2017, so as you can imagine, the difference is enormous! Moto g56 comes with Android 15 out of the box. While I was setting up the phone, the security version was updated to July 2025. Everything rolls smooth so far - the OS, the change between the apps, etc. It's pretty quick with everything and I haven't encountered any lags. The build quality gives you the feeling that you hold something more expensive and the colour of it makes the phone pretty beautiful (Grey mist). It comes with pre installed radio app, which you have to enable it in Play Store. The music coming out of the earphones connected to the 3.5 jack port is very clear with so many choices to select due to Dolby Atmos app. Battery lasts 2 days with full use, even though the battery is still ""learning"" my pattern use. I believe it has the capability to become even better. As for the camera, for a mediocre user like me, I get very nice shots with natural colours and a solid video capture in 60 fps Reply",2025-08-16 00:00:00,,GSM Arena,Technical Review,1062,2025-09-12 17:22:58.737811

Moto G Stylus 5G (2025),Anonymous,"? Anonymous kJW 14 Aug 2025 The Stylus 2025 has a Snapdragon 6 Gen 3, which is about 10% faster than the Snapdragon 6 Gen 1 (Stylus 2024), and the GPU is about 30% faster than the SD 6 Gen 1. The Display is excellent, but it has a 27% higher resolution @ 1220 x 2712 pixels than the 1080 x 2400 pixels (Stylus 2024). For all those wondering why the battery life is not as amazing as the Stylus 2024. Here is your answer, an unneeded/unnoticeable increase in resolution. The GPU has to run higher just to power the extra pixels. The battery life is still good, just not as good as the Stylus 2024. The specs on this Stylus 2025 are excellent for the low price point. The camera is also excellent for a midrange phone. Reply",2025-08-14 00:00:00,,GSM Arena,Technical Review,722,2025-09-12 17:22:58.737811

I can get through a full day on a single charge, but I was expecting at least a day and a half, preferably 2 days battery life. But the performance is stellar for the amount of money I paid, the A16 iPad is fast and smooth even with the 60Hz IPS panel. Another thing that really bothers me though, is the quality of third party apps. Some are good and look like they are designed specifically for iPad, while others are just ported, upscaled iOS apps. Most if not all of the ported iOS and web apps look horrible, and this include even some of the biggest mainstream apps. The low res, messy layouts, giant texts, blurry images and whatnot.

V60,Anonymous,"? Anonymous 2A3 13 Aug 2025 Vivo's continued use of UFS 2.2 has become legendary. Most likely at this price point it would only be the V60 that uses the aging UFS 2.2. Even with a slightly upgraded SoC, the V60 will take forever to process photos from its decent imaging system. Maybe Vivo has an oversupply of UFS 2.2 storage chips that's why they are still using them at 2025. Reply",2025-08-13 00:00:00,,GSM Arena,Technical Review,384,2025-09-12 17:22:58.737811

There's a very good reason why Sony put back the 3.5mm audio jack on the 2020 Xperia 1 II after two years of removing it from their flagship smartphones, and not just because of better audio quality.

X200 FE,Anonymous,"O Osama Ahmad 6Qj 12 Aug 2025 Class C freefall, only 800 charge cycles, class C repairability, Ufs 3.1, seriously Vivo? Couldn't you atleast make the mobile more sturdy especially when it's so small. A smaller and lighter device ought to be more durable. And after your sister companies have been using batteries with 1600 or i think some models with even 1800 hundred charge cycles, you give it a battery with only 800 charge cycles, that's pathetic and Vivo has been getting worse since it's started to sell well. You'll meet the same fate as Xiaomi jf you keep it up. And so much for your special phone glass, what a joke. I can accept the repairability score being bad since the phone is very small and thus tend to have space limitations, naturally. However, how much more the ufs 4 storage would have cost, 5 bucks maybe. This is expected from a company still using ufs 2.2 storage, lpddr 4x ram and the trash of Qualcomm, Snadragon 7 gen 3 and 7 gen 4 in Vivo v50 and upcoming Vivo V60 respectively, it's upper mid range phones, they are trash now but used to be good.

At first I found it unbelievable for phones to have more than 5000 mAh, now when I see 5000, it looks pitifully small and 6500 seems like the new normal and now when I see 8000, which is almost double of 5000, it's unbelievable again. Soon there will be 10000 mAh Chinese phones, while prideful and arrogant Apple/Samsung still struggling to release phones with ""massive"" 5001 mAh batteries and call it revolutionary if they don't create explosions as powerful as C4.

Up until this generation of Exynos, I would have thought the same thing... foolish to entertain Exynos Anything. However, the 2500 is using RDNA 3 graphics, benchmarks show it neck and neck with Snapdragon Gen 2 in terms of performance, trading slightly with battery life and performance (slightly less battery life for better overall performance). The Vulkan support by the Xclipse 950 GPU equipped by the 2500 puts is at an advantage for anyone doing emulation or wanting better native vulkan support. Side by side, this chip should be very efficient and performant without the drawbacks that typically come with Exynos.

Smartwatches are more than just time watching now. They are for reading emails, messages, calendar etc. However, the round screen isn't ideal for such. I hope Samsung will make the Watch9 screen square and keep the round the screen on the next Classic watch for those who want the rotating bezel. But vanilla Watc9 should have square screen.

K13 Turbo Pro,Anonymous,"8 80085 uvR 04 Aug 2025 Some thoughts after spending a week on bilibili. 1. camera is doodoo. low light is doodoo+. 2. on average 2Â°C cooler with fan at full speed. 3. FPS more stable during long gaming sessions compared to other 8sgen4. 4. battery life is on par with maybe even better than poco F7 (7550mah). 5. fan is super quiet. 6. IPX9 seems legit, multi layered glue and gaskets around the fan internally. 7. The oppo cooling kit case is cool af. 8. speakers are good. dedicated secondary speaker. 9. screen bright enough but not as bright as poco F7. 10. not sure how durable the fan will be long term, already saw 2 videos showing fans which sound like a jet taking off. tldr 2Â°C cooler than other 8sgen4 while providing pretty much the same fps (1-3 more fps in some cases) and more stable fps for 1+ hr sessions.

Galaxy Z Fold7,Anonymous,"F Fau PFB 04 Aug 2025 ViperX, 02 Aug 2025 Samsung is like the master of poor battery life This is a bad take, honestly. This take *could* be acceptable now that other companies are implementing silicon carbide batteries and Samsung hasn't, but Samsung still manufactures phones with great batteries. Now, are they good compared to other companies? Not really. However, when you consider that Galaxy flagships (the S24 Ultra and S25 Ultra) are easily 2-day battery phones with 4-5 hour screen on time, you start to realize that Samsung still makes capable phones with proper batteries. Now, I'm not sure if the Fold7 in particular has a greater battery life than the Fold6, or is even remotely acceptable to be considered a game-changing foldable in the now diverse industry since I haven't checked the battery tests on the Fold7. However, what I can tell you is that I've watched reviews of the Fold6, and it lags lightly behind the S24 Ultra in terms of battery life, which is understandable since the Fold6 is a 4400mAh battery while the S24 Ultra is a 5000mAh with a single 6.8 inch screen. In short, calling Samsung a master of poor battery life is simply inaccurate. What *is* correct, however, is that Samsung is currently facing a period where they're lagging behind competitors in terms of battery life; not necessarily meaning they're bad at battery management. OnePlus had a phase (OP 10 to OP 12-ish period) where they too were lagging behind the competition. However, as of right now, OnePlus seems to be dominating the landscape along with Oppo with their latest OnePlus 13. TL;DR: This take is pretty bad. Samsung may not be implementing industry-leading batteries right now, but that doesn't mean they're not implementing good batteries on their devices.

Galaxy S25 Edge,Anonymous,"? Anonymous Cxp 02 Aug 2025 No escape for battery. Carbon battery are hazardous and wear twice as fast. They tried to improve for years and failed. No way to go for there now. Battery s25 edge is too low considering actual standards for most people I haate iOS and apple's lock down but I'd go 16+, twice battery performance sure it's spec are lower....twice is really something.  Also android and Samsung forcing cloud and locking down too nowadays. Still I prefer android but they should stop the b.s. Even that edge s25 has great camera can't deny I Will wait for that Ip 17 air but I guess it'll be  same krap of battery ( I read they might sell a battery case, makes no sense. at same time I've a IP 12 mini with a MagSafe battery....) They should improve make lower power sucker proc and screen we don't need 2 millions AnTuTu and raytracing on that shyt. Battery I think actual tech is very limited improvement . let's see ip 17 air with TDK whatsoever new battery tech if it really improves something or if it's vaporware. Better wait for now. Wait and see if it really improves weight and battery and all with ip17 air and s26. That's how I'll decide to replace my s23 myself.

No special feature for video editing,in a world that is already content??????
The screen can easily break with a little touch of a hard object even with a screen guard on it,who does that??

I have tested the sound inside the review and it is rather close to the same volume as the Z Fold7. Yet, Z Fold 7 was rated as -28.3 LUFS while this is -25.7 LUFS. I would have believe that the test is credible if they were to state it in the range of around -29.0 LUFS to -28.0 LUFS. Absolutely no consistency in the tests which they have conducted.

It makes sense for them to be skeptical of the new silicon carbide technologies. Although, I could be wrong. These are why I think they're not implementing silicon carbide batteries: 1. Playing it safe: The Note7 left a scar on them. 2. Relatively new: It's a new technology in the Smartphone world, so they're waiting to see if it passes all the bells and whistles of a safe Smartphone. Although, this theory is the one that disappoints me the most, considering back in the 2010s, Samsung were the pioneers of new technology. 3. It's expensive: Since it's a new technology, Samsung may wait for R&D to bring the production cost down. They already know that their flagships cost in the range of $1300 (which is still, unfortunately, more expensive than Apple's $1200 for the iPhone 16 Pro Max). If they implement silicon carbide batteries in say, the S26 lineup, they may have to cut costs somewhere (maybe a further S-pen nerf) to keep the price at $1300.

Galaxy Z Fold7,Anonymous,"? Anonymous n2g 28 Jul 2025 I personally think that is the most stupid design ever, not just the Samsung one every one who builds up foldable crap... I don't want a huge camera bump they would better design it one side a bit thicker with no camera bump and the folding side thinner... The camera bump takes thinness to absurd extremes. If the camera bump is thicker than the phone itself, the device wobbles back and forth when placed on a table, making it virtually unusable. There could hardly be a more stupid design.

Reno14 F,Anonymous,"m mikezizz ucX 28 Jul 2025 And by the way what are the chances of a replacement? Im afraid of them saying its within the industrial standard and there is no replacement. So i will list down the problem just in case: 1. Recent task will cause flickering - when brightness level set to just slightly above the sun logo 2. Going to apps folders will cause flickering - when brightness level set to just slightly above the sun logo. 3. Enable 'disable permission monitoring' (in case wanna use wireless debugging) will cause crazy flickering blinking + auto dim every 3 seconds or so when you're reading something (like from Whatsapp, telegram, reddit etc.) 4. Flicking whenever pull notification bar. 5. Storage read/write is way too slow. Mine (43.8GB used out of 512GB) 6. read/write for SD card is too ridiculous, hardly able to read if you have alot of music/photos in a folder unless you have ample of time to wait. (Mine 61.4GB used out of 512GB). I believe with software update can help fix a thing or two here. So OPPO please do something about it.

Galaxy Z Fold7,Anonymous,"B Betuvsky 8va 28 Jul 2025 Hey, this foldable is really worth it! So here it is! The Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 is out and, honestly, itâ€™s quite a blast. It was officially released on July 25, 2025, so if youâ€™re a fan of foldable phones, you can now check it out. Design and feel in hand: The first thing thatâ€™ll hit you is how much thinner and lighter itâ€™s become. Seriously, the Fold 7 is now much slimmer and more comfortable to carry than previous models. Samsung claims 8.9 mm thickness, but in reality, itâ€™s even thinner â€“ just 8.82 mm. And the hinge? Itâ€™s been improved â€“ itâ€™s sturdier, and the crease on the inner screen is less noticeable. Best of all, the external cover screen is wider (6.5 inches, 21:9 aspect ratio), making it much more usable for everyday tasks without needing to unfold the phone constantly. Plus, itâ€™s got an IP48 certification, meaning itâ€™s more resistant to water and dust. Nice! Displays â€“ a feast for the eyes: Unfold it and youâ€™re greeted with a stunning 8.0-inch AMOLED display. The resolution is 2184 x 1968 pixels and it supports an adaptive refresh rate ranging from 1 to 120 Hz â€“ everything looks super smooth and crisp. The outer display has a resolution of 2520 x 1080 pixels. Both screens are bright, detailed, and ideal for multitasking, watching content, or gaming. Truly a joy to look at! Performance under the hood: Inside, itâ€™s powered by the latest Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy processor. This beast ensures the phone flies, no matter how many apps you open or what demanding games you play. With improved AI features, the Fold 7 is optimized for smart interactions and enhanced experiences with AI tools like Gemini Live. Multitasking on this phone is just a dream â€“ you can switch between apps seamlessly with zero lag. Cameras â€“ now thatâ€™s the big deal! This is where major upgrades happened. The Galaxy Z Fold 7 boasts a 200MP main camera (compared to the 50MP on the Fold 6), along with a 12MP ultra-wide lens and a 10MP telephoto lens. This means your photos will be far more detailed and high quality. There are also new AI photo editing tools, like â€œSuggested Erasesâ€, which automatically remove unwanted objects from the background. The front camera on the cover screen is 10MP. Battery and charging: The battery keeps the same capacity as the Fold 6 â€“ 4400 mAh, but Samsung promises longer battery life â€“ up to 24 hours on a single charge. It supports 25W wired charging, 15W wireless, and 4.5W reverse wireless charging. Software: The phone runs on Android 16 with One UI 8, specifically optimized for the foldable format, offering features for multi-screen use. And the best part â€“ Samsung promises up to 7 major software updates, which is fantastic for long-term support. Price and availability: The Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 starts at $1,999.99 (in the Czech Republic, the price will likely start around CZK 50,000 or more, depending on the configuration). Yes, itâ€™s expensive, but considering what it offers, for tech enthusiasts, every penny is worth it. In conclusion: The Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 is without a doubt an impressive piece of hardware that pushes the boundaries of foldable phones. Its thinner and lighter design, amazing displays, flagship performance, and huge camera upgrade make it a very appealing choice for those looking for the ultimate foldable experience. Despite the high price, it represents a significant step forward in foldable smartphone technology. Hope you liked this more casual review!

Security wise it is a nightmare and I call it drama. Even if its secured if the user is not that smart enough to use it,then still youre a prey to scammers and hackers. Android is the best software thats no doubt the only reason why android is not good is because of the OEM itself,they dont invest thier time fixing their own iteration of android,unlike samsung. If there is someone to blame thats the OEM itself creating a phone yearly and dont spend time to optimize the software to the hardware where is was installed.

It may be network related, but within the same network, at the same time, the Vivo is snappier. On the other hand, the camera (ironically) seems to be doing fine and almost at par except for zoom and macro shots. Yes, it has the perceived Apple data privacy, security, and ecosystem capability but somehow doesnt seem to justify its price. And I am not even getting into the AI aspects at this point.

Considering i never spend much on phones, i abandoned the idea of getting a phone with anything more than 3 years of software updates, and went ahead and bought the X7 pro months ago thinking it was an insane deal considering its battery size, processor, etc. Can you explain how my 5 year-old,4000mAh, LG K61 outlasts this brand new, 2025, 6000mAh piece of junk (with every possible optimization done) by half a day? It only lasts a freaking day! With average, non demanding use, and no gaming! Also, you mentioned overheating, did you even use a X7 pro? you can fry an egg on it with 10 minutes of YouTube. In comparison, a friend of mine got the GT7 a week ago, and it lasts him 2.5 days with similar use, guess which of us is laughing. Assuming GT7t battery life should be similar to the GT7 and because it gives you 6 freaking years of software updates at this price point, there is potentially great value in this phone.

C75x,Ratel,"Member Nu7 25 Jul 2025 I'm currently using Realme C75x which I bought a few weeks ago. Pros 1.	The charging speed is faster (at less than 40 minutes from 0-100) and not at GSM Arena's 90 minutes. 2.	The mono speaker is super loud, but has no bass. 3.	Fall resistance is real. I deliberately threw it from a 2-storey building onto an interlock floor without a pouch, and it survived the fall without a scratch or a dent. 4.	I left it a bucket of water from 8p.m. till 9a.m. (25 hours), and battery didn't go down, and the phone is not damaged. 5.	The battery life was superb when I first got it. 6.	I don't play games on phones. So I don't know anything about its game-playing ability. 7.	When it's used to snap documents, it's very sharp. 8.	The call quality is good. 9.	The phone is loud during calls, even in a noisy environment, but I donâ€™t know if itâ€™s noise-cancellation ready. 10.	It doesnâ€™t get hot even in an extreme 45â° C. condition. Cons 1.

C75x,Ratel,"Member Nu7 25 Jul 2025 I'm currently using Realme C75x which I bought a few weeks ago. 1. The charging speed is faster (at less 40 minutes from 0-100) than GSM Arena's 90 minutes. 2. The camera production is weak. Pictures look sharper when taken, but grainy when you zoom in. 3. The mono speaker is super loud, but has no bass. 4. Fall resistance is real. I deliberately threw it from a 2-storey building onto an interlock without a pouch, and it survived the fall without a scratch or a dent. 5. I left it a bucket of water from 8p.m. till 9a.m. (25 hours), and battery didn't go down, and the phone is not damaged. 6. The battery life was superb when I first got it, but it now drains faster if it's not set to power saving mode after a ...930 software update. 7. The phone can deliberately lag for some minutes. 8. I don't play games on phone. So I don't know anything about its game-playing ability. 9. When it's used to snap documents, it's very sharp. I love the phone, but I'm still missing my Huawei P30 Pro and Samsung A33. Reply",2025-07-25 00:00:00,,GSM Arena,Technical Review,1039,2025-09-12 17:22:58.737811

X200 FE,Anonymous,"J Josh19911 CJH 24 Jul 2025 Just bought one for approx $735 usd in Pakistan. Overall I'm happy with everything, phone looks and feels premium. Screen and back camera is really good, front camera is average. Performance is good for my need, I was skeptical about UFS 3.1 but I don't feel any slowdowns while gaming or casual use. My only gripe is extremely slow charging speed, even with fast charging on. I had the same issue with Vivo V40. It's not a deal breaker for me but seeing the phone peak charge at 25w and mostly around 12w looks very disappointing, with the advertised 90w charger supplied.

It's stays mostly cool via charging and i think this is what it's helping it the most. Battery is impressive, never used Pixel beside in-store test so i have no idea what the battery could be, but i'm using the 16 PM and the battery backup is verry good, 2-day battery without gaming - no problems, not at all. Fast charging also. I have no idea what kind of magic Apple did to the charging and why it's rated so low, while in reality is comparable with Android's rivals but you have to buy it to see it. On paper it's weak while acutally it's not. I'm coming from Xiaomi with 90W and charging is mostly comparable, very rapid till 80%. Xiaomi has faster start but then runs hotter.

No reason for the price tag they couldn't have done both 45 watt and 5500mah batteries in silicon carb. Just lazy engineering and high price tags but they are banking on one born everyday....

Galaxy Z Fold7,Anonymous,"? Anonymous kmq 18 Jul 2025 With the camera island protrusion, the compatibility and resulting poor actual efficiency for wireless charging might have many footnotes in the fine-print.  Might be slow and/or hot for any misaligned Qi chargers.  Kind of a no-no for EU regulators desire to reduce [Qi] charger e-waste.  Yeah, Qi2, but the questions remain.  Hope to be wrong after the pre-order shows up.  Already does not fit my Qi2 power bank.  Maybe Samsung leadership forgot to do a market survey to merchandise a compatible wireless charging stand in the box...or will send me one free as an apology.

There was a bit more chance of that when the SD 8 Elite was initially announced all device would have UWB by default, then Qualcomm clarified IHVs/mfrs could opt not to implement it, so likely still would've been missing if Samsung went with SD 8E instead, just like they kept it off Flip 6, 5, 4 but had it on Folds. Annoying for anyone with Samsung's own SmartTag2 , as a result I won't recommend them anymore until that changes (go 3rd party if you lose UwB anyways, thus gain iOS). All current iPhones have it, even the entry level, and have had for a while, so it makes no sense to not be on a flagship Flip not ALL of the S series cheaping out on the regular S25. ðŸ¤¬ PS, needs to be said, especially here, not promoting Apple, just F'in annoyed yet another Flip doesn't have UWB! ðŸ˜¡ Reply",2025-07-16 00:00:00,,GSM Arena,Technical Review,901,2025-09-12 17:22:58.737811

And abt multitasking - iPhone has it, while Android on paper does it better, but it's RAM management is poor on majority of brands and their buggy UI's and they close apps radnomly while doing something in the background.

Galaxy Z Flip7,Anonymous,"T Tazman IB5 11 Jul 2025 Geric.770, 10 Jul 2025 Hold on, this year's flip is using EXYNOS!? By now you should've known that was a possibility after it being leaked over 3 months ago (and F7FE using E2400 leak at beginning of year) , plus Flip7 E2500 benchmarks leaking over a month ago.. We'll have to see how much of a difference it makes, especially for battery & thermals more so than benchmark performance. I would prefer an SD8 Elite over an Exynos on principal, but not if they cripple everything that makes it better. Just look at the Moto 60 Ultra's performance numbers in the review here, it loses to Flip 6 AND 50 Ultra's weaker SD8S G3 in Geekbench single core,  ties the Flip6 in multi-core and is far FAR from the Xiaomi 15 in ALL tests despite having 4GB more RAM ! It also throttled almost immediately and couldn't even finish GSMA's GPU stress test. What's the point in that, other than paying extra for a chip you can't even use? If they had to cripple the SD 8E to get it to work in the Flip7 like they did the Moto, or even the SD 8G3 in Flip6 (no WiFi 7, No Dex, No UWB), then what's the point? For most people Exynos 2500 with Dex and other minor features beats a heavily throttled SD8E. The biggest question mark (other than the claimed/supposed fixed battery/thermals Exynos problems) is likely can the E2500 do all the Ai / OS / UI tasks that the SD8E devices can, that's more likely to be the make/break point rather than a few points/fps difference on a benchmark, and somewhere where the extra 4GB should theoretically make a difference. Still wish it had UWB and camera upgrades to the two leftovers from the original Z Flip, and improved charging of course, but personally care less about charging than the others. LTPO cover would have also been nice, but 120hz is a step in the right direction at least. Reply",2025-07-11 00:00:00,,GSM Arena,Technical Review,1840,2025-09-12 17:22:58.737811

Galaxy Watch8 Classic,Anonymous,"U Ugou DM6 09 Jul 2025 Samsung's innovation is now apparently questionable. They take one step forward, two steps backward. After adding additional sensors(ie bioactive, blood oxygen , etc) they reduced the screen size , put up a mediocre old-gen battery tech when we now have new-gen battery tech like the lithium-silicone battery that could easily make them bump the battery capacity from the current 445mah to 500mah while still maintaining the sleek look of the watch, old-gen Bluetooth version 5.3 when Bluetooth 6.1 is out already.... I can go on and on. The Samsung of now isn't the Samsung we used to know about a decade ago. They used to be the pioneers in these sort of things, I guess corporate greed has gotten a hold of them, all they care about is the most profit they can salvage off of consumers. About time they step up their game. Otherwise, they'll be left in the dust to these Chinese OEMs innovating aggressively. They're in the decline anyway. Let's see how the next decade turns out for themâ€” if they continue in this selfish trajectory, they'll sure be stuggling to get a grip of the saturated smartphone/watch market share like Sony is currently. A hard pass for me anyway. Sticking to my 6Classic. Reply",2025-07-09 00:00:00,,GSM Arena,Technical Review,1231,2025-09-12 17:22:58.737811

All of our debit, credit cards are ... more you are the one living under a rock, basic UPI payments gained traction around 2020 and became the norm in 2023. As for NFC, it has been limited to the richer tier 1 cities and at most used in the shopping hubs in tier 2. Phones in India rarely come with NFC at the sub 20k range because the market simply doesn't have the need. This is changing fast though, most of the 2025 releases have NFC and NFC payments are being tried at some mid tier shops. To say that, NFC is used widely in India is just plain stupid. If you earn 30k per month, you are earing more money than 80% of the population (850 million people), and I don't think NFC payments are a primary concern for any of them. NFC has been seen as the ""rich dude payment method"" for decades at this point. NFC can only be said to be widespread once the t2 city rural area vegetable vendor starts accepting NFC payments.

I think even before Samsung smartphones existed it would be pretty easy to find a house with a Samsung product (fridge, TV, washing machine, microwave, DVD player etc) huawei on the other hand was largely an unknown brand outside of China until the android era. Lifting sanctions against huawei is something I want but wanting to stop sales of Samsung phones makes no sense when America's relationship with south Korea is a lot less tense than its relationship with China. Huaweis presence in the android market definitely helped people trust them more but Samsung already had a headstart due to them already being well known much like Apple. Chinese brands should be more popular but a lot of them don't put in any real effort outside of China and India. Reply",2025-07-07 00:00:00,,GSM Arena,Technical Review,953,2025-09-12 17:22:58.737811

T4 Lite,Anonymous,"? Anonymous 83@ 27 Jun 2025 Since information about vivo T4 Lite's specifications is based on a WILD GUESS, because vivo T4 Lite is not release yet until 2025, July 02, so it's basically impossible for anyone to achieve accuracy from writing specifications for a smartphone who currently doesn't exist yet. So I'm skepticism to information about vivo T4 Lite's specifications in GSMArena that the resolution of vivo T4 Lite is 720x1600 pixels. I will just wait until 2025, July 02, or days after that date, and then I will watch YouTube that showing an unboxing videos for vivo T4 Lite by vloggers, and usually that vloggers will also gave review about a product that became the object of an unboxing videos. And after I watching YouTube, then I got information about vivo T4 Lite's specifications with 100% accurate concerning information about the resolution of vivo T4 Lite.

Galaxy Z Flip7,Anonymous,"? Anonymous gXJ 23 Jun 2025 Anonymous, 10 Mar 2025 Still no telephoto zoom? While I am bummed, the list of clamshells with both a telephoto and an ultrawide is just two: the Oppo Find N3 Flip and the Huawei Pocket 2, or three if you count the Huawei Pura X. There are other options with a telephoto including the Xiaomi Mix Flip and Motorola Razr 50 Ultra/Razr+ (2024/2025), but they both lack the ultrawide camera. And besides, all the telephoto cameras on clamshells (besides Huawei) are 2x optical zoom anyway, and Huawei's clamshell telephotos are a measly 8MP in resolution (3x optical zoom for the Pocket 2, 3.5x for the Pura X).

Galaxy Z Flip7,Anonymous,"? Anonymous gXJ 23 Jun 2025 I think rumours pointed to a 4,300mAh battery, which, while not huge, is a step forward. Only the upcoming Mix Flip 2 with its 5,100mAh battery will be a major outlier. Ironically, it's only 100mAh smaller than the far bigger Z Fold 7, which needs more power because of the large internal display.

Samsung phones always have low PWM frequency OLED, which shows how greedy and shameless they are. Not only do they not care about PWM sensitive customers, they also seem to sarcastically imply that you either spend money to buy their crappy OLED phone, or spend a lot of money to buy a low-end crappy LCD phone.

Galaxy Tab S10 FE+,Anonymous,"G Ghostwolf87 raN 14 Jun 2025 I have had this tablet for a month now as a replacement for my 2020 S6 Lite. This is a great tablet.  Battery last me two days of solid use in note taking, YT and Netflix watching, and Kindle and Manga reading. It multi tasks just fine for me, with Vivaldi browser and Writing app for note taking running side by side. I donâ€™t need it to game.  That is what my desktop PC or laptop running Linux is for.  This tablet goes to work every day with me and gets used daily. Putting a matte film screen protector didnâ€™t degrade image quality or colors, at least to my eyes.  It makes using it under the lights at work, and outside, much easier. So if you are looking for an economical tablet with a great screen and good battery life, plus having like 6 or 7 years of promised updates from Samsung, it will be hard to beat this. Are there higher speced devices from the Chinese manufacturers?  Sure, but they will be e-waste in two or three years if not sooner when software support stops.  At least Samsung is backing their devices for the long term. Reply",2025-06-14 00:00:00,,GSM Arena,Technical Review,1085,2025-09-12 17:22:58.737811

,Anonymous,"a ashrobb LTy 07 Jun 2025 While this is quite expensive in Europe, here in LATAM it is priced reasonably at around 260 USD. I needed a spare phone and since I'm tired of Xiaomi and their software, I decided to give it a try. - It does have both NFC and a hybrid SIM slot that can take a micro SD card. - Build quality seems good, screen is decent, it has HDR, PWM implementation isn't the best in this one but it isn't terrible. - Battery life is very good... I charged it to 100%, 26 hours ago, and after 7 hours of SoT I still have 53% battery left. Overnight drain is very frugal, very efficient chipset here, and it also performs nicely. Haven't tested many games but it does the job as long as you don't expect the best graphics. - Selfie cam is good, main cam is also good under well lit conditions. It shows its weaknesses when the lights go down, but it was to be expected. Still reliable for most of the stuff you need. - Software wise, very stable, optimized, up to date security patches and stuff. Overall, quite surprised with this phone. For the price I paid, better deal vs the Redmi Note 14 Pro 5G, Samsung A36 or Moto Edge 60 Fusion, all of them are over 330 USD here.

Usually that's the case with most midrangers, but nope vivo chose to equip it with decent sensors, let alone equip it with a telephoto.

Pad 2,Anonymous,"X XenoMagami In{ 28 May 2025 I bought one of these earlier this year. Performance wise, it's fantastic; snapdragon 8 gen 3 with a 3K 12"" display, 12GB of RAM? For 600 dollars? Sign me up. Speakers sound great, and mine came with the pen. General use is silky smooth, that SOC plus the display make the navigation seamless. no lag whatsoever when browsing menus even with a decent amount of background apps open. Any game you want to play will run flawlessly, and has enough power for more demanding applications. Downsides; 3:2 aspect ratio means most videos are going to be cropped. Accessory support isn't there, and the fact that they made this an updated model of an existing ""Pad 2"" means that you have to specifically look for cases and screen protectors built for the 12.1"" model instead of the 11"" version from 2023. Only cases available are folding cases or flimsy silicone bumpers that offer no structural support so if it's dropped it'll still likely shatter the screen, and they don't offer cases with a storage space for the pen to charge. Camera could be better but it's not bad. If you plan to use this for a car, surprise, it has no built in GPS so you'll need to find some way to share location data from your phone to the tablet. If you can get past the downsides, it's a great device for using at home for general use or even as a drawing tablet with the pen. Unless someone can make a multilayer case I wouldn't trust myself taking this device around in public and I definitely wouldn't trust it around younger users because there's no good way to protect it from drop damage as of yet.

C75x,Anonymous,"R Reviewer 7Xc 24 May 2025 Zah, 10 May 2025 Hey is it worth it if I want to change from Redmi 9T to this? The processor is throwing me off... more Honestly, the only thing this phone has going for it is its durability. When it comes to performance, it's quite underwhelming. If you're looking for something better, I'd recommend the Samsung Galaxy A05s â€“ it's more affordable and still offers great specs for daily use and casual gaming. It's a solid budget option. If you're willing to spend a bit more but still on a budget, consider the Samsung Galaxy A16 LTE. Itâ€™s a mid-range phone with even better performance, a vibrant AMOLED display, and overall great value for the price. Lastly, old flagship models. They offer lots.. But the only downside is secondhand. But it's your choice, I won't interrupt. Respected ye opinions Reply",2025-05-24 00:00:00,,GSM Arena,Technical Review,838,2025-09-12 17:22:58.737811

C75,Anonymous,"D DimC NUw 23 May 2025 This phone is perfect for my construction job. Purchased during my trip to Indonesia. I live in Canada. In Canada, Fido does not recognize VoLTE in this model, Freedom Mobile does, so I switched from Fido to Freedom to make this phone work. Also, this model supports many more LTE frequency bands than listed. Why would Realme be shy about it? But it's good news to me. I observed it using LTE bands 2,4,5,7,13,38,41,66. I'm pretty sure it also supports band 71, as per Mediatek Helio G92 spec sheet. Bands 2,4,13,66, 71 are not listed. In Indonesian pamphlet even band 7 is not listed. Strange world we live in. Other than that, camera is good enough to take work related photos and videos. I don't understand where ""50 megapixels"" are, quality is like 13 megapixels, but it's good enough for me. Only one camera seem to work, the other 2 are mysterious. Also the speaker sound is just regular single speaker mono sound, ""400%"" is not what it says it is but it's loud enough for me.

iPhone 16 Plus,Anonymous,"L LittleKid D0i 18 May 2025 I like the phone very much. Iâ€™m an android user and I switched to iOS for fun. First of all IOS is smooth but when I compared it to my s25 they both are same. Even though other android phones give us smoothness in experience than iOS eventually they became laggy.I tested it with my s21 and iPhone 11 and I was surprised coz iPhone gives smoother experience latest OS updates and also the camera was great. In these case if s25 can keep up with iPhone then for sure android is better. Most of the people focuses on camera then itâ€™s win to win for both ï£¿ and Samsung.TBH There are better camera phones than these two. Consider vivo x200 ultra or Xiaomi 15 ultra. They both leading not only in camera but also in software and performance. For a middle class one I donâ€™t recommend this iPhone coz there are great pics like iqoo ,Xiaomi , and vivo iPhone is a bit over priced I know but their ecosystem usability and durability should make this phones to use more than five years. Overall I give this phone 8.5/10 rating And I donâ€™t think 60 hertz screen are bad. For gamers I would recommend 120 hertz. ðŸ™‚ Reply",2025-05-18 00:00:00,,GSM Arena,Technical Review,1148,2025-09-12 17:22:58.737811

iPhone 16,Anonymous,"C CrimsonShadow890 4Ap 14 May 2025 Honestly, anyone considering this phone should just buy the iPhone 15 Pro. You'll get a much better screen and cameras, and it still supports apple intelligence, the AAA games, and the action button. Plus, the performance difference is really small, and if anything, the 15 Pro will feel faster because of the higher refresh rate screen. So I see no reason why anyone should buy this phone when a better option from the same brand exists for the same price Reply",2025-05-14 00:00:00,,GSM Arena,Technical Review,497,2025-09-12 17:22:58.737811

1. Screen TFT LCD wait IPS or Super... more TFT stands for thin film transistor that is the controll panel on the back of all these including AMOLED, IPS, AHVA, PLS, VA, PVA, S-PVA, ASV, TN, etc. AHVA is advanced hyper viewing angle and is IPS not VA. I was waiting for AMOLED since 1992 and I have and use AMOLED from 2011, but I guess LCDs are used on Xcover and some active tablets because thesw can be brighter and still reliable outside in day light, either just with powerful backlight or hybrid with backlight + transreflective.

Galaxy XCover7 Pro,Anonymous,"B Biff IrW 09 May 2025 Yes, it looks like the skeptics are right and the XCover 7 Pro is borked with no 3.5mm port.  A shame as I've been waiting a long time to upgrade and now they've lost my business.  And for what?  A second speaker?  I don't ever even use 1 speaker.  I use my headset for privacy.  Their design engineer needs to be reassigned to burger-flipping duty. The irony is that super-cheap Android phones at Walmart have both a removable battery and a 3.5mm jack.

Razr 60,Anonymous,"j jayde 7MZ 05 May 2025 [deleted post] I've just found the answer to that on Motorola website under specs:  'In the Box Components Signature packaging fragrance'.  Well at least now I know they're still adding that reek of nasty, allergy inducing 'perfume'. So disappointed ðŸ˜ž  Cameras on razr 60 just a good as Samsung z flip 6 spec wise, unfolded screen slightly bigger and I much prefer moto UI which also has less bloatware. I much prefer the overall look and feel of the razr over the z flip. The faux leather offers grip without needing an additional cover which would add bulk. Complete idiots forcing perfume on people! Even if not allergic surely most people prefer to choose their own fragrances?  I previously had razr 40 and eventually the smell wore off the phone but I had to leave the box in the garden shed. I really liked the phone but unfortunately dropped it unfolded and the screen broke.  There was also some sand ingress from using it on a windy beach. Motorola have now matched current z flip 6 water and dust protection at IP48 although only for larger dust particles.

The manual also mentions that headphones need to be USB-C type. That makes the XCover7 Pro the first XCover phone without a headphone jack. I hope the new larger-capacity battery is backwards compatible with the older XCover6 Pro, as that would mean there is at least something useful with this release. The XCover7 Pro itself seems like a downgrade at this point. Reply",2025-04-17 00:00:00,,GSM Arena,Technical Review,691,2025-09-12 17:22:58.737811

Galaxy XCover7 Pro,Anonymous,"Z Zakalwe Tu9 16 Apr 2025 exp1orer, 15 Apr 2025 this is not for people who want to listen to FM radio whilst using the phone in his/her job. .... more To be fair, before the XCover6 Pro the XCover phones had FM radios. I don't think there is much of a plan behind that feature, it is more a matter of whether the phone happens to have the tech to make it work. I.e. if there is FM integrated in the SoC and a headphone jack to serve as an antenna, then the manufacturer can simply ""unlock"" the functionality. Old chipsets usually had FM and XCovers had audio jacks, so they got the radio. But most modern phones no longer have the audio jack, so chipsets have been dropping the FM because few phones can have the antenna to use it, hence modern phones tend to lack at least one condition to get FM. Samsung kept FM around longer in their Exynos SoCs, so the XCover Pro and FieldPro both have FM radios. But the XCover6 Pro switched to Qualcomm 778G, which does not come with FM, so no radio despite the antenna. And the XCover7 Pro seems to lack both the FM and the antenna.

You know when chipset produced not all yields good results. Some outputs are expected and the rest are ""least"" expected. The ""least"" expected output doesnt necessarily mean they are bad or non functional. Theyre just performing less below the expected performance. You can google ""SoC Binning"" or ""Chipset binning"" for detailed info. Relate that with Apple's conserving policies then it would be more make sense why they dont want simply put binned chips to trash. Just like what they did on binned A17 Pro inside Mini 7 iPad. By the way, A16 is currently producing out of TSMC's Arizona plan. Might be a slight tactical move by Apple amidst tariff's uncertainties nowadays.

iPhone 16 Pro,jsoprano75,"NI9 05 Apr 2025 I got this phone as a work phone through my company. It's a great phone, but its freaking heavy. A phone with a 6.3 inch screen and it weights almost 200 grams! That's the problem with iPhones, especially compared to a Samsung of similar size. Samsung phones are much lighter and easier to carry, especially in the pocket. For reference, the much smaller 16 Pro even weighs more than the Galaxy S25 plus. The S25 plus has a 6.7 inch screen and only weighs 190 grams. The camera island on the 16 pro is one of the major reasons. Its massive, and it protrudes so much that it looks ridiculous. If you sit it down flat on a table, it wobbles like crazy. I decided to just use the iPhone 12 for work. It's the smallest iPhone they've made in recent years (aside from the mini's), and it only weighs about 164 Grams. It's easy to use one handed and it doesn't bulge in your pocket or feel like a brick. The 16 Pro is a much more superb phone, but they made it too big and too heavy. They should have stuck with the 6.1 inch screen and made the phone thinner so it's lighter. With how the 16 Pro feels, you may as well just get the 16 Pro Max.

iPhone 16 Pro,Anonymous,"M Matt J4x 05 Apr 2025 Ok, this is my new phone.  I've always owned Apple phones back the iPhone 4 in 2011. My last one was iPhone 12 mini that had a terrible battery and I've decided to move to Android plattform, looking for greater battery/screen but I regreted doing this, terrible mistake. Android phones are cheap but you also get a cheaper experience, awful cameras, systemwide Google annoyances, unsafe environment, etc. The list of disadvantages goes far as I can enlist them. So, I moved back to iPhone and decided to get premium one. It's a night and day difference, the camera is so damn great and using iOS is so nice and smooth. Everything just works out of the box, no hacking and messing with external apps. You don't need to dowload Gcam apk, you don't need to rely on custom apps, fix this and fix that. I'm very happy with my purchase and I'll never consider an Android phone again. Google also lost me as consumer as I moved to Bing search engjne and even deleted my account.

But in the end the race will be won by someone who can offer a highly optimized and flexible OS, performance (in terms of AI and device capability), and price. I both have an upper midrange iPhone and a low-midrange Android (Moto G84) so i feel i have the best of both worlds. For now, the iPhone serves my needs. Yes it could be better in some ways but having a ""closed OS"" means the phone functions and acts the way it should and the way I want it. Android's issue still remains: fragmentation.

iPhone 16 Plus,Gino76ph,"LaZ 14 Mar 2025 This afternoon i went to an Apple Store. Pretty much most of my questions (apart from around 2-3 which i forgot to ask) got an answer all thanks to a friendly Apple person who was there to actually listen and happy to show me things. I made my decision and I will be getting an iPhone 16 Plus due to it's ideal size for my hands - not too tall or wide or heavy. Wanted a Galaxy S25+ but was too expensive. Then Pixel 9 but i just think (apart from the cameras) stock Android is not up to speed with the industry. Another question that pops to mind is: If i decide to buy an iPhone from a third-party private reseller and they forgot to disable or turn off the ""Find my iPhone"" feature will that be an issue if i initially set up the phone? Or is there a workaround? Reply",2025-03-14 00:00:00,,GSM Arena,Technical Review,787,2025-09-12 17:22:58.737811

The s10 is not a good tab in the future use and a slower chipset than the m2 according to me (correct Me if im wrong) plus it would be good pairing your iPhone with it too.

iPad Pro 13 (2024),Anonymous,"? Anonymous CbG 25 Dec 2024 As a marine engineer from India, I am torn between three devices for my online studies, content consumption, and trading activities: the Samsung Galaxy S10 Ultra, Apple iPad Air M2, and iPad Pro M4. I currently use an iPhone 15 Pro Max and am seeking a device that will seamlessly integrate with my existing ecosystem. The devices' prices are as follows: - Samsung Galaxy S10 Ultra (base model): â‚¹79,000 with 1 year of free accidental damage coverage - Apple iPad Air M2: â‚¹75,000 (without Apple Pencil or Apple Care+) - Apple iPad Pro M4: â‚¹1,19,000(without Apple Pencil or Apple Care+) Key considerations for my purchase decision include: 1. *Future-proofing*: Will the Samsung Galaxy S10 Ultra's processor be sufficient for the next 7 years, considering the promised 7 years of OS updates? Similarly, how will the iPad Air M2 and iPad Pro M4 hold up in the future? 2. *Upcoming releases*: Should I wait for the rumored new iPad Air with M3 processor, expected in early 2025, which may come with a free Apple Pencil Pro? 3. *Additional costs*: Galaxy Al will become a chargeable service from 2026. What are the potential costs associated with each device, including repair costs? 4. *Ecosystem integration*: As an iPhone user, I value seamless integration with my existing Apple devices. Or should I switch to samsung galaxy tab just for studies? Considering my requirements and the factors mentioned above, I would appreciate your expert guidance on choosing the ideal device for my needs. Thank you for your time and consideration Reply",2024-12-25 00:00:00,,GSM Arena,Technical Review,1572,2025-09-12 17:22:58.737811

Surprisingly it came upgraded out of the box to 18.1, it was upgraded by Apple in-box at warehouse in Central Time US, maybe New Mexico. Apple is eager to upgrade anything. First thing I did was to disable auto upgrades and auto downloads and I will never upgrade it, it will remain to 18.1 to the next 5 years.

iPad Pro 13 (2024),Anonymous,"m massutiti nT0 29 Sep 2024 Anonymous, 25 Sep 2024 Who would get this? Get a Macbook lol But I want touch screen. I'm gonna replace my iPad Pro 10.5 2017 with this. Timing is great, as it was the first Apple tablet with 120hz refresh rate, and this is the first with OLED screen. And Apple ended updates for it this year, and battery is going bad. I want the larger screen, and I still prefer 4:3 aspect ratio to others. If I want to watch videos in a bigger screen, I can use monitors or TV's. Actually I just want it to be large in both dimensions. Samsung Ultra also is (12.9"" in 4:3 window), but resolution is much lower. Also lower resolution overall. Not going into other specs now. I gave tablets points with my own system, S10+ got 5, S10 Ultra got 6 and iPad Pro 13 got 7 :() Also I don't use tablets for ""work"", full size PC is for that. Also no need for a laptop.

iPhone 17,Anonymous,"D DNS tui 7 hours ago Reading those comment making me feel funny and annoyed. Till this day and date, there is no need doing any comparison as these are confirmed incremental update which occur yearly, and not really comparable to Android. For me, just don't fall deep into the proprietary ecosystem on both side then you are free to choose which platform you wish to go. However, for me, thanks god we still has Android which offer true freedom rather than fall deep into Apple product which geared towards proprietary. Pricing and specs don't really speak about real experience. Yes, I prefer Android more for a reason, but not mean Apple product is bad, just that they are not as flexible. Also Apple side is all about spending more, getting more, but not guarantee work for more, they lock something for their own good. Android side is all about own choice, you can customized your choice, not really need to follow mainstream, yet still not far away from flagship experience, but really cost effective.

How is paying an additional 1000â‚¬ for an additional 2TB illegal if its the ONLY PHONE IN THE ENTIRE WORLD to offer 2TB of Internal Storage? Do you even know the price of the 2TB IC? Where is your Basis that UFS 4.0 is twice Faster than the NVME on the 17 Pro Max? You keep mentioning the Pro but not the Pro Max. You think this year's iPhone 17 Pro Max will have the Same RAM FREQUENCY as the LAST YEAR'S iPhone 16 Pro Max? You're telling People about the tech cost. But you forgot to mentioned that Apple Pays the Devs. Big! Which is why there's so many apps being made Exclusively on iOS. Yes, android is Cheap. And you can get a 12GB RAM/512GB Android Phone like $200 or less. But Android doesn't pay the Devs. BIG. Which is why when iOS gets a AAA games like the Hitman World of Assassination, Assassins Creed Mirage, Sniper Elite 4, then by Q1 2026 Sniper Elite 5,  Death Stranding, and many more. You keep asking. When it will come to Android. And if you think Emulation Solves the Problem? Google just declared that by 2026. Sideloading will be Banned. Turning Android into a WALLED GARDEN like the iOS. Reply",,,GSM Arena,Technical Review,1661,2025-09-12 17:22:58.737811

Till this day and date, there is no need doing any comparison as these are confirmed incremental update which occur yearly, and not really comparable to Android. For me, just don't fall deep into the proprietary ecosystem on both side then you are free to choose which platform you wish to go. However, for me, thanks god we still has Android which offer true freedom rather than fall deep into Apple product which geared towards proprietary. Pricing and specs don't really speak about real experience. Yes, I prefer Android more for a reason, but not mean Apple product is bad, just that they are not as flexible. Also Apple side is all about spending more, getting more, but not guarantee work for more, they lock something for their own good. Android side is all about own choice, you can customized your choice, not really need to follow mainstream, yet still not far away from flagship experience, but really cost effective.

iPhone 17,Anonymous,"? Anonymous jde 9 hours ago jiyen235, 10 hours ago apple's 2x is extremely competent as well so the lack of a telephoto isnt a huge pain.

... more Those statement of ram management ks b.s. even coders donâ€™t know how it works nowadays. They just kill processes, limit number of tabs and so on. Itâ€™s tricked and itâ€™s easy to catch. On macOS they sneakily swap maybe they do that on iOS too. They optimize yes but about ram it canâ€™t be magic especially with Â´modernâ€™ apps which are mostly based on html and js. Anyway itâ€™s more than enough for most use and android in last version 14+ really did bad with memory 4gb kr just doesnâ€™t really work so itâ€™s true nonethelesss.  But itâ€™s not appleâ€™s magic itâ€™s more googo doing shiiiit Reply",,,GSM Arena,Technical Review,755,2025-09-12 17:22:58.737811
iPhone 17,Anonymous,"? Anonymous jde 9 hours ago Stevre, 11 hours ago Have an iPhone 13, will the camera alone be worth upgrading or will it still basically be the same? I think so. Iâ€™ve an iPhone 13 I find the pictures a bit  lackluster. My s23 is better in that regards and has 48mpix. Could be the processing, I know. Probably it gives some better zoom too as base iPhones donâ€™t have telezoom Aperture seems important too and is probably lower so better low light picture. Just my guess Iâ€™m a basic camera user.
