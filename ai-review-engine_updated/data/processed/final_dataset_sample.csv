Originally asked about battery durability, but ended up arguing with AI as it could not submit sufficient detail in order for the claim ""A is better than B"". ""OnePlus phones potentially have better power consumption or batter than other Android brands, but actual efficiency depends heavily on usage scenarios such as screen brightness, app type, network conditions, gaming intensity, and background processes. Therefore, claims of general superiority in power efficiency should be made cautiously and case-by-case.""

Oh and it was even thinner at 4.8mm, even if the 5.5 inch screen meant it was larger overall than the Allview (for those wondering both also had 3.5mm ports). I genuinely do not understand why people think this Air is at all impressive, this battery size could probably be achieved in the same shell of either of these 2014 phones simply with the advancements we've had in battery technology in the last 11 years.

Galaxy A07 4G,Anonymous,"? Anonymous y6W 11 Sep 2025 I bought this phone to replace my old S20 FE as my secondary phone. Honestly, it's cheap and it shows. Cameras and speakers are par for its price segment - not something that I'd use when I go out, not even at home. I only play Pokemon Unite, and I do not like the A07's performance, lol. If you're getting this phone, it should be for the reason that you need a secondary phone. If you're buying this as a daily driver, remember this is a budget phone. If you just want something that opens your apps (socmed, fintech, online shopping) it's a good choice. What I like about it is the long software support since I just want a phone that continues to receive security updates. The battery usage is also quite good even on the first day of use. But the charging is slower than I anticipated despite me using the same charger for all my phones. Oh, it doesn't come with a wall charger, if you mind that. So for a secondary phone, it's a good deal. That means it's the phone that would only be tapped when it sounds a notification.
