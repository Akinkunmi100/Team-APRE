Honestly, it's cheap and it shows. Cameras and speakers are par for its price segment - not something that I'd use when I go out, not even at home. I only play Pokemon Unite, and I do not like the A07's performance, lol. If you're getting this phone, it should be for the reason that you need a secondary phone. If you're buying this as a daily driver, remember this is a budget phone. If you just want something that opens your apps (socmed, fintech, online shopping) it's a good choice. What I like about it is the long software support since I just want a phone that continues to receive security updates. The battery usage is also quite good even on the first day of use. But the charging is slower than I anticipated despite me using the same charger for all my phones. Oh, it doesn't come with a wall charger, if you mind that.

Key details on the autofocus capabilities: Rear Cameras: All three rear lensesâ€”the 50MP main, 12MP ultrawide, and 8MP telephotoâ€”have autofocus. The main and telephoto lenses use Dual-Pixel Phase Detection Autofocus (PDAF) for fast and reliable focusing.

It was a huge upgrade from my previous XCover Pro, and for the first three weeks, it was a fantastic device. As someone with an active lifestyle, I've always prioritized rugged phones, and the initial performance and feel of this model lived up to my expectations. Durability Test: The Drop That Broke the Screen (1/5 Stars) Unfortunately, the real test came in the third week. The phone took a spill from my waist onto a concrete sidewalk. While my previous Active phones and Xcover Pro had taken similar falls without issue, the screen on this phone shattered completely. For a rugged phone with Gorilla Glass that's designed to withstand these kinds of impacts, this was extremely disappointing and not what I expected at all. The Repair Saga: A Test of Patience (0/5 Stars) My real frustrations began when I tried to get the phone repaired. The process has been a nightmare from start to finish. June 23rd: Sent the phone to Samsung. July 14th: Finally received a diagnosis and was able to pay for the screen repair, nearly three weeks later. A few days later: I was notified that parts were unavailable, causing a week-long delay. After another week: Samsung began the process to issue me a credit instead of a repair, which also took more than a week to arrive. August 7th: The e-coupon finally arrived, nearly a month and a half after I sent the phone in. September 9th (and counting): The coupon, which is only valid on the Samsung.com business site where this specific phone is sold, doesn't work. I've spent over three weeks trying to get help from customer service, but the issue remains unresolved. It is now over two and a half months since I sent my phone in, and I still don't have a working device or a functioning way to get a replacement. Final Verdict While the phone's hardware was initially impressive, the lack of durability in a real-world scenario and the absolutely frustrating and time-consuming repair process are major red flags. I cannot in good conscience recommend this product. My advice to anyone considering this phone is to save yourself the trouble and look for a more reliable company that stands by its products and its customers.

The maximum mAh before the 20 Wh threshold is reached at that voltage is 5218 mAh. 17 Pro Max is rumored to be around 5000, so 20 Wh could already be reached with 18 Pro Max if the capacity continues to increase. From there on, the next options are either dual cell (and in that case, I think itâ€˜s possible that Apple would give dual cell to the smaller model as well to reach and advertise faster charging speeds) or thinner+lighter design. Iâ€˜d personally appreciate thinner and lighter, but the camera capabilities of the standard model are good enough for me, so if they went with thin and light on the standard models (like they already plan to do with 17 Air, if that would expand to the 6.3 inch 18 that would be great), Iâ€˜m fine if the Pro models are thicker and heavier for extra battery runtime and charge speed. The strategy could be like with MacBook Air and MacBook Pro. The cheaper models are very thin and light, the Pro models are thicker and heavier but with better specs.

I come from xiaomi hyperos and had other phones recently. It is the first phone for me that mever had any throttling and battery drain. Games run super smooth and also recently i got an update that forced many games like cod warzone to go beyond 60fps. Believe it or not, I've never encountered any bug so far. Ui works flawlessly. Maybe its due to the chinese rom. I knew about notification delay and i had that in my phones before so that doesn't bother me anymore. There are chinese stuff here and there and some can't be changed to english and after a short time i turned off some ai stuff and that no longer gets on my nerve.

My earlier device was Moto G34 which gave me stellar service for a year and was one of the reasons I opted for a Motorola phone. Main points after few days of use : 1) Excellent battery life. I am easily getting 2+ days with heavy internet use and YouTube videos. 2) Excellent bright crisp display. 3) Good cameras with ultrawide and OIS. Lack of OIS was one reason Oppo K13 was not purchased. 4) Sturdy build with IP69. The phone looks well built and much better IMO than Vivo T4R. 5) Less bloatware than Oppo K13 and Vivo T4R. Very few apps that need to be uninstalled. The other advantage is since I was already using a Moto switching over to a new device was easy from day 1 due to OS familiarity.

Also I can make phone stand like tent on table.  I donÂ´t get bigger video with tha aspect of big screen. All cameras are good.

Cant go fully 2 days but then just charge j85% every day so itÂ´s fine. When I want to act quick and make photo, I hate that I donÂ´t have camera button to quick open camera. makes me 1 sec slower then on prevoius phone. Also I hate how much Samsung, Android uses to many Samsung apps when many Orginal Google are really good. New this before bought phone and know I donÂ´t need to use many of these Samsung. Think price on this phone is way to high, but as they give me Galaxy Buds3 Pro and Galaxy Watch Ultra with it it looked OK.  Samsung Galaxy Buds3 Pro are something I would not buy or recommend friends to buy.  Sound is nothing special, itÂ´s not hanging good enough in ear and quite away from the best in headsets like Bose and Sony so I already give it away.   This watch is mostly good, but probably they give away as itÂ´s have one big fault.  All these Samsung and Apple watches have to little time on battery, but because of some new sensors they needed to take away wirless charging option for that watch so you are always stuck with charing cable.

Up until this generation of Exynos, I would have thought the same thing... foolish to entertain Exynos Anything. However, the 2500 is using RDNA 3 graphics, benchmarks show it neck and neck with Snapdragon Gen 2 in terms of performance, trading slightly with battery life and performance (slightly less battery life for better overall performance).

This take *could* be acceptable now that other companies are implementing silicon carbide batteries and Samsung hasn't, but Samsung still manufactures phones with great batteries. Now, are they good compared to other companies? Not really. However, when you consider that Galaxy flagships (the S24 Ultra and S25 Ultra) are easily 2-day battery phones with 4-5 hour screen on time, you start to realize that Samsung still makes capable phones with proper batteries. Now, I'm not sure if the Fold7 in particular has a greater battery life than the Fold6, or is even remotely acceptable to be considered a game-changing foldable in the now diverse industry since I haven't checked the battery tests on the Fold7. However, what I can tell you is that I've watched reviews of the Fold6, and it lags lightly behind the S24 Ultra in terms of battery life, which is understandable since the Fold6 is a 4400mAh battery while the S24 Ultra is a 5000mAh with a single 6.8 inch screen. In short, calling Samsung a master of poor battery life is simply inaccurate. What *is* correct, however, is that Samsung is currently facing a period where they're lagging behind competitors in terms of battery life; not necessarily meaning they're bad at battery management. OnePlus had a phase (OP 10 to OP 12-ish period) where they too were lagging behind the competition. However, as of right now, OnePlus seems to be dominating the landscape along with Oppo with their latest OnePlus 13. TL;DR: This take is pretty bad. Samsung may not be implementing industry-leading batteries right now, but that doesn't mean they're not implementing good batteries on their devices.

The Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 is out and, honestly, itâ€™s quite a blast. It was officially released on July 25, 2025, so if youâ€™re a fan of foldable phones, you can now check it out. Design and feel in hand: The first thing thatâ€™ll hit you is how much thinner and lighter itâ€™s become. Seriously, the Fold 7 is now much slimmer and more comfortable to carry than previous models. Samsung claims 8.9 mm thickness, but in reality, itâ€™s even thinner â€“ just 8.82 mm. And the hinge? Itâ€™s been improved â€“ itâ€™s sturdier, and the crease on the inner screen is less noticeable. Best of all, the external cover screen is wider (6.5 inches, 21:9 aspect ratio), making it much more usable for everyday tasks without needing to unfold the phone constantly. Plus, itâ€™s got an IP48 certification, meaning itâ€™s more resistant to water and dust. Nice! Displays â€“ a feast for the eyes: Unfold it and youâ€™re greeted with a stunning 8.0-inch AMOLED display. The resolution is 2184 x 1968 pixels and it supports an adaptive refresh rate ranging from 1 to 120 Hz â€“ everything looks super smooth and crisp. The outer display has a resolution of 2520 x 1080 pixels. Both screens are bright, detailed, and ideal for multitasking, watching content, or gaming. Truly a joy to look at! Performance under the hood: Inside, itâ€™s powered by the latest Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy processor. This beast ensures the phone flies, no matter how many apps you open or what demanding games you play. With improved AI features, the Fold 7 is optimized for smart interactions and enhanced experiences with AI tools like Gemini Live. Multitasking on this phone is just a dream â€“ you can switch between apps seamlessly with zero lag. Cameras â€“ now thatâ€™s the big deal! This is where major upgrades happened. The Galaxy Z Fold 7 boasts a 200MP main camera (compared to the 50MP on the Fold 6), along with a 12MP ultra-wide lens and a 10MP telephoto lens. This means your photos will be far more detailed and high quality. There are also new AI photo editing tools, like â€œSuggested Erasesâ€, which automatically remove unwanted objects from the background. The front camera on the cover screen is 10MP. Battery and charging: The battery keeps the same capacity as the Fold 6 â€“ 4400 mAh, but Samsung promises longer battery life â€“ up to 24 hours on a single charge. It supports 25W wired charging, 15W wireless, and 4.5W reverse wireless charging. Software: The phone runs on Android 16 with One UI 8, specifically optimized for the foldable format, offering features for multi-screen use. And the best part â€“ Samsung promises up to 7 major software updates, which is fantastic for long-term support. Price and availability: The Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 starts at $1,999.99 (in the Czech Republic, the price will likely start around CZK 50,000 or more, depending on the configuration). Yes, itâ€™s expensive, but considering what it offers, for tech enthusiasts, every penny is worth it. In conclusion: The Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 is without a doubt an impressive piece of hardware that pushes the boundaries of foldable phones. Its thinner and lighter design, amazing displays, flagship performance, and huge camera upgrade make it a very appealing choice for those looking for the ultimate foldable experience. Despite the high price, it represents a significant step forward in foldable smartphone technology. Hope you liked this more casual review!

I left it a bucket of water from 8p.m. till 9a.m. (25 hours), and battery didn't go down, and the phone is not damaged. 5.	The battery life was superb when I first got it. 6.	I don't play games on phones. So I don't know anything about its game-playing ability. 7.	When it's used to snap documents, it's very sharp. 8.	The call quality is good. 9.	The phone is loud during calls, even in a noisy environment, but I donâ€™t know if itâ€™s noise-cancellation ready. 10.	It doesnâ€™t get hot even in an extreme 45â° C. condition. Cons 1.	The camera production is weak. Pictures look sharper when taken, but grainy when you zoom in. 2.	The battery drains faster within 3 hours from 100 to 40% in extreme social media usage if itâ€™s not set to power saving mode after a â€¦930 software update. But it endures from 40 to 3% for more than  8 hours. 3.	Front-facing camera is useless in a lowlight condition. I love the phone, but I'm still missing my Huawei P30 Pro and Samsung A33.

By now you should've known that was a possibility after it being leaked over 3 months ago (and F7FE using E2400 leak at beginning of year) , plus Flip7 E2500 benchmarks leaking over a month ago.. We'll have to see how much of a difference it makes, especially for battery & thermals more so than benchmark performance. I would prefer an SD8 Elite over an Exynos on principal, but not if they cripple everything that makes it better. Just look at the Moto 60 Ultra's performance numbers in the review here, it loses to Flip 6 AND 50 Ultra's weaker SD8S G3 in Geekbench single core,  ties the Flip6 in multi-core and is far FAR from the Xiaomi 15 in ALL tests despite having 4GB more RAM ! It also throttled almost immediately and couldn't even finish GSMA's GPU stress test. What's the point in that, other than paying extra for a chip you can't even use? If they had to cripple the SD 8E to get it to work in the Flip7 like they did the Moto, or even the SD 8G3 in Flip6 (no WiFi 7, No Dex, No UWB), then what's the point? For most people Exynos 2500 with Dex and other minor features beats a heavily throttled SD8E. The biggest question mark (other than the claimed/supposed fixed battery/thermals Exynos problems) is likely can the E2500 do all the Ai / OS / UI tasks that the SD8E devices can, that's more likely to be the make/break point rather than a few points/fps difference on a benchmark, and somewhere where the extra 4GB should theoretically make a difference. Still wish it had UWB and camera upgrades to the two leftovers from the original Z Flip, and improved charging of course, but personally care less about charging than the others. LTPO cover would have also been nice, but 120hz is a step in the right direction at least.

This is a great tablet.  Battery last me two days of solid use in note taking, YT and Netflix watching, and Kindle and Manga reading. It multi tasks just fine for me, with Vivaldi browser and Writing app for note taking running side by side. I donâ€™t need it to game.  That is what my desktop PC or laptop running Linux is for.  This tablet goes to work every day with me and gets used daily. Putting a matte film screen protector didnâ€™t degrade image quality or colors, at least to my eyes.  It makes using it under the lights at work, and outside, much easier. So if you are looking for an economical tablet with a great screen and good battery life, plus having like 6 or 7 years of promised updates from Samsung, it will be hard to beat this. Are there higher speced devices from the Chinese manufacturers?  Sure, but they will be e-waste in two or three years if not sooner when software support stops.

Performance wise, it's fantastic; snapdragon 8 gen 3 with a 3K 12"" display, 12GB of RAM? For 600 dollars? Sign me up. Speakers sound great, and mine came with the pen. General use is silky smooth, that SOC plus the display make the navigation seamless. no lag whatsoever when browsing menus even with a decent amount of background apps open. Any game you want to play will run flawlessly, and has enough power for more demanding applications. Downsides; 3:2 aspect ratio means most videos are going to be cropped. Accessory support isn't there, and the fact that they made this an updated model of an existing ""Pad 2"" means that you have to specifically look for cases and screen protectors built for the 12.1"" model instead of the 11"" version from 2023. Only cases available are folding cases or flimsy silicone bumpers that offer no structural support so if it's dropped it'll still likely shatter the screen, and they don't offer cases with a storage space for the pen to charge. Camera could be better but it's not bad. If you plan to use this for a car, surprise, it has no built in GPS so you'll need to find some way to share location data from your phone to the tablet. If you can get past the downsides, it's a great device for using at home for general use or even as a drawing tablet with the pen. Unless someone can make a multilayer case I wouldn't trust myself taking this device around in public and I definitely wouldn't trust it around younger users because there's no good way to protect it from drop damage as of yet. Reply","x xenomagami in 28 may 2025 i bought one of these earlier this year. performance wise, its fantastic snapdragon 8 gen 3 with a 3k 12 display, 12gb of ram? for 600 dollars? sign me up. speakers sound great, and mine came with the pen. general use is silky smooth, that soc plus the display make the navigation seamless. no lag whatsoever when browsing menus even with a decent amount of background apps open. any game you want to play will run flawlessly, and has enough power for more demanding applications. downsides 32 aspect ratio means most videos are going to be cropped. accessory support isnt there, and the fact that they made this an updated model of an existing pad 2 means that you have to specifically look for cases and screen protectors built for the 12.1 model instead of the 11 version from 2023. only cases available are folding cases or flimsy silicone bumpers that offer no structural support so if its dropped itll still likely shatter the screen, and they dont offer cases with a storage space for the pen to charge. camera could be better but its not bad. if you plan to use this for a car, surprise, it has no built in gps so youll need to find some way to share location data from your phone to the tablet. if you can get past the downsides, its a great device for using at home for general use or even as a drawing tablet with the pen. unless someone can make a multilayer case i wouldnt trust myself taking this device around in public and i definitely wouldnt trust it around younger users because theres no good way to protect it from drop damage as of yet. reply",1612,294,0.2265432098765432,0.5499999999999999,positive,"[('camera', ""space for the pen to charge. camera could be better but it's not""), ('screen', 'ecifically look for cases and screen protectors built for the 12.1'), ('screen', ""t'll still likely shatter the screen, and they don't offer cases w""), ('display', 'pdragon 8 gen 3 with a 3k 12"" display, 12gb of ram? for 600 dollars'), ('display', 'lky smooth, that soc plus the display make the navigation seamless.'), ('performance', ""e of these earlier this year. performance wise, it's fantastic; snapdra""), ('storage', ""they don't offer cases with a storage space for the pen to charge."")]","[{'aspect': 'camera', 'sentiment': 'positive', 'polarity': 0.5}, {'aspect': 'screen', 'sentiment': 'neutral', 'polarity': 0.0}, {'aspect': 'screen', 'sentiment': 'neutral', 'polarity': 0.0}, {'aspect': 'display', 'sentiment': 'neutral', 'polarity': 0.0}, {'aspect': 'display', 'sentiment': 'positive', 'polarity': 0.25}, {'aspect': 'performance', 'sentiment': 'positive', 'polarity': 0.3666666666666667}, {'aspect': 'storage', 'sentiment': 'neutral', 'polarity': 0.0}]",['performance'],False,0.0,False,1.0,1.0,True,True,2025.0,5.0

How is paying an additional 1000â‚¬ for an additional 2TB illegal if its the ONLY PHONE IN THE ENTIRE WORLD to offer 2TB of Internal Storage? Do you even know the price of the 2TB IC? Where is your Basis that UFS 4.0 is twice Faster than the NVME on the 17 Pro Max? You keep mentioning the Pro but not the Pro Max. You think this year's iPhone 17 Pro Max will have the Same RAM FREQUENCY as the LAST YEAR'S iPhone 16 Pro Max? You're telling People about the tech cost. But you forgot to mentioned that Apple Pays the Devs. Big! Which is why there's so many apps being made Exclusively on iOS. Yes, android is Cheap. And you can get a 12GB RAM/512GB Android Phone like $200 or less. But Android doesn't pay the Devs. BIG. Which is why when iOS gets a AAA games like the Hitman World of Assassination, Assassins Creed Mirage, Sniper Elite 4, then by Q1 2026 Sniper Elite 5,  Death Stranding, and many more. You keep asking. When it will come to Android. And if you think Emulation Solves the Problem? Google just declared that by 2026. Sideloading will be Banned.
