Cameras and speakers are par for its price segment - not something that I'd use when I go out, not even at home. I only play Pokemon Unite, and I do not like the A07's performance, lol. If you're getting this phone, it should be for the reason that you need a secondary phone. If you're buying this as a daily driver, remember this is a budget phone. If you just want something that opens your apps (socmed, fintech, online shopping) it's a good choice. What I like about it is the long software support since I just want a phone that continues to receive security updates. The battery usage is also quite good even on the first day of use. But the charging is slower than I anticipated despite me using the same charger for all my phones. Oh, it doesn't come with a wall charger, if you mind that. So for a secondary phone, it's a good deal. That means it's the phone that would only be tapped when it sounds a notification. Reply","4.0","2025-09-11 00:00:00","GSM Arena","True","2025.0","9.0"

Speaking of which, Apple should by law be made to provide its own phone cases fitted with lanyard strap holes as standard because to make a sweep panorama sucessfully you do need to be able to use a strap around your neck stretched out with your hands holding the phone to be able to keep the phone at the same distance from you as from your subject. Further, the Ultrawide camera NEEDS image stabilization built-in for any use at all, like the main camera and the telephoto. Nobody should ever have their video image cropped and resized by electronic stabilization. As this has not changed, and as the Ultrawide module is the same as last year buying a 17 is pointless.

"REV_000208","USER_ANON_01421","Galaxy XCover7 Pro","Samsung","A Active lifestyle use Gxt 09 Sep 2025 Initial Impressions: The Phone Itself (3/5 Stars) When I first unboxed this phone, I was excited. It was a huge upgrade from my previous XCover Pro, and for the first three weeks, it was a fantastic device. As someone with an active lifestyle, I've always prioritized rugged phones, and the initial performance and feel of this model lived up to my expectations. Durability Test: The Drop That Broke the Screen (1/5 Stars) Unfortunately, the real test came in the third week. The phone took a spill from my waist onto a concrete sidewalk. While my previous Active phones and Xcover Pro had taken similar falls without issue, the screen on this phone shattered completely. For a rugged phone with Gorilla Glass that's designed to withstand these kinds of impacts, this was extremely disappointing and not what I expected at all. The Repair Saga: A Test of Patience (0/5 Stars) My real frustrations began when I tried to get the phone repaired. The process has been a nightmare from start to finish. June 23rd: Sent the phone to Samsung. July 14th: Finally received a diagnosis and was able to pay for the screen repair, nearly three weeks later. A few days later: I was notified that parts were unavailable, causing a week-long delay. After another week: Samsung began the process to issue me a credit instead of a repair, which also took more than a week to arrive. August 7th: The e-coupon finally arrived, nearly a month and a half after I sent the phone in. September 9th (and counting): The coupon, which is only valid on the Samsung.com business site where this specific phone is sold, doesn't work. I've spent over three weeks trying to get help from customer service, but the issue remains unresolved. It is now over two and a half months since I sent my phone in, and I still don't have a working device or a functioning way to get a replacement. Final Verdict While the phone's hardware was initially impressive, the lack of durability in a real-world scenario and the absolutely frustrating and time-consuming repair process are major red flags. I cannot in good conscience recommend this product. My advice to anyone considering this phone is to save yourself the trouble and look for a more reliable company that stands by its products and its customers.

The issue is which GPU the SoC manufacturer uses, when there are those that offer more performance. Not everything is the same thing.

I have charged my old motorola full during many nights and it lasts since 5 or 6 years. Yes, i start charging when its evening and it has less than 70%, or when it reaches around 30, more often 20%. It can wear out the battery, of course, but there is one thing that does worse damage in comparison: plugging out the charger before disconnecting the phone. this can cause severe issues if done too often.

The maximum mAh before the 20 Wh threshold is reached at that voltage is 5218 mAh. 17 Pro Max is rumored to be around 5000, so 20 Wh could already be reached with 18 Pro Max if the capacity continues to increase. From there on, the next options are either dual cell (and in that case, I think itâ€˜s possible that Apple would give dual cell to the smaller model as well to reach and advertise faster charging speeds) or thinner+lighter design. Iâ€˜d personally appreciate thinner and lighter, but the camera capabilities of the standard model are good enough for me, so if they went with thin and light on the standard models (like they already plan to do with 17 Air, if that would expand to the 6.3 inch 18 that would be great), Iâ€˜m fine if the Pro models are thicker and heavier for extra battery runtime and charge speed. The strategy could be like with MacBook Air and MacBook Pro. The cheaper models are very thin and light, the Pro models are thicker and heavier but with better specs.

I would never get such a heavy phone but as a one off, how about they get ahead of the other Chinese brands (BBK/Xiaomi/Huawei/Transsion), which are now at 8000 and planning for 10000, by building a phone with 11000, or even 16000 to get ahead of even the current ambitions of the other Chinese. Just this phone but with 16000 mAh and 17mm thickness and 400g to finally shush the people here asking for bigger and bigger batteries. And one variant with 11000 mAh and 12mm thickness and 300g weight. Shouldnâ€™t cost that much, and if the phone is useless it can at least be used as a power bank for a good phone.

And they don't run out of charge. TWS have their own advantages over wired IEMs too, of course, but lets not pretend that they are always universally better and that having physical jacks is somehow holding something back. We all know that the real reason why 3.5 is getting removed is because it forces people to buy TWS, preferably the same brand as the phone, as that is a device that has a guaranteed expiry date because of the consumable nature of batteries.

Maybe if you turbo charge and heavy game in wild boost mode but it also cools down in barely a few minutes it's impressive how much you can push the device, and yeah maybe if you run an endurance test with all the gaming stuff cranked on an older update it could cause issues but you have the option for more normal settings too where it runs fine. No game ever crashed on me yet even with boost mode + charging,  at 120fps mode 3D games haven't dipped under 90fps on me. Reply","3.0","2025-09-04 00:00:00","GSM Arena","True","2025.0","9.0"

If you are looking for a phone with SD card slot, look elsewhere. You can barely use your SD card if its more than 100GB (mine is 366GB out of 1TB) Every seconds the phone refreshes/scans the sd card that makes any file hardly load. Even if you have fully loaded the whole sd card files/folder it will scan/refresh again after few minutes. For my case everytime i have to wait 10-15mins to access/view/load something. Few minutes later i have to wait another 10-15mins again. I CAN HARDLY LISTEN TO MUSIC AND VIEW MY PHOTOS!!! My music app have to constantly work extremely hard to access those files. I thought this thing onky happened to my old sd card (SanDisk Extreme Pro 512GB) But No! This also happen to my newly bought Samsung Sonic The Hedgehog microSDXC 1TB which i bought 2. All these SD Card works fine, in fact flawlessly on my older devices OPPO RENO 7Z, Xiaomi Mi Max and SHARP Aquos R8s Pro. Currently they have two major problems (this is after recent update) 1. Brightness going crazy when enabling disable permission monitoring drom the developer options (previously this causes massive flickering) 2. Storage performance particularly SD Card. Horrible, Horrible, Horrible. Can barely use the SD Card. Probably purposely doing this to promote Cloud Storage or to get users to buy Phone without SD card slot.

Man.... more when you repair phones you will understand, i do it from 15 years ago and i know what i write here, its my personal experience. Im not saying sd439 its more powerfull than mediatek g80, i say mediatek SoCs turn very slow after a year or more of moderate to full usage, my redmi 8 still smother than i buit, my brother redmi 9 now its more slow than my redmi 8. He stored 2 years ago for that, I install lineage0S and no diferences, i repair many mediatek phones from samsung, motorola, huawei... and its the same with all of them, very slow. i install custom os on many snapdragon phones and no speed problem. OS updates its like all brands time ago, only few updates and then to trash, no more support, not only xiaomi. ALL brands dont make eternal phones. My experience with xiaomi its fine, more than samsung with all that bloatware and bad internal design on low entry and mid range phones, now xiaomi are making more durable phones than samsung and other popular brands... more xiaomis i repair its for broken screen, samsung and others its more for flex, usb ports, charging problems, and broken screens too.

I heard they now have global rom for it now My phone came with the Chinese ROM, and while I wish I had the global ROM, the Chinese version works perfectly fine. After making a few adjustments and disabling the MI AI Assistant, the phone feels just right. Having returned to Xiaomi after a few years, I initially didnâ€™t like the OS, but now that Iâ€™ve gotten used to it, the phone is excellent. I particularly love the Gallery app, as the built-in video editor allows you to create AI-generated videos. The video software is quite advanced. Iâ€™m even considering getting a Xiaomi tablet if it offers similar featuresâ€”itâ€™s fantastic for content creation. You can also extract text from photos of anything with writing on it, which really surprised me since my old Realme couldnâ€™t do this. On top of that, it includes a built-in ChatGPT-style writing assistant. Even the camera is actually quite good. I have to say, this phone was well worth the money, and I hope Xiaomi makes more large phones with this aspect ratioâ€”or even an 18.5:9 display. This phone and its features genuinely blew me away once I realized what the software is capable of. Reply","5.0","2025-08-31 00:00:00","GSM Arena","True","2025.0","8.0"

Redmi 9's soc three times more powerful than r8's. Also seems like you don't understand the concept of chip degradation. Chip degrades only in overclocked overvolted condition which is only possible on desktop computers (where overclocking is allowed). High voltage (significantly above recommended) and high temperatures physically destroy the chip so it can't hold even default frequency on default voltage. That's not possible on mobile devices.

My earlier device was Moto G34 which gave me stellar service for a year and was one of the reasons I opted for a Motorola phone. Main points after few days of use : 1) Excellent battery life. I am easily getting 2+ days with heavy internet use and YouTube videos. 2) Excellent bright crisp display. 3) Good cameras with ultrawide and OIS. Lack of OIS was one reason Oppo K13 was not purchased. 4) Sturdy build with IP69. The phone looks well built and much better IMO than Vivo T4R. 5) Less bloatware than Oppo K13 and Vivo T4R. Very few apps that need to be uninstalled. The other advantage is since I was already using a Moto switching over to a new device was easy from day 1 due to OS familiarity. I feel Motorola have a winner here and I expect this phone to sell well. It has most of the features needed for day to day use. Reply","5.0","2025-08-24 00:00:00","GSM Arena","True","2025.0","8.0"

There is not much upgrade over the previous model. This is Samsung particular way to distinguish among the series. So I have no more question. It is good already. Samsung has good quality product so far compared to the ones China brand. We can't simply forget the software update which is longer than the ones again from China brand. The lasting that we should take into our mind is we will never make our money wasted from buying device out of Samsung. As an alternative you may consider product from Xiaomi if you have limited budget but still thinking to get high quality product comes with commonly lower price. The only issue is just on software update which normally shorter than Samsung. But if you the one who uses phone and replace it every 2 or 3 years, I don't see it will be a problem.

Redmi 9's soc three times more powerful than r8's. Also seems like you don't understand the concept of chip degradation. Chip degrades only in overclocked overvolted condition which is only possible on desktop computers (where overclocking is allowed). High voltage (significantly above recommended) and high temperatures physically destroy the chip so it can't hold even default frequency on default voltage. That's not possible on mobile devices. This ""mtk bad"" thing is not a problem then the real issue is deliberate slowing with updates. Every xiaomi redmi (not sure about flagships I've never owned them) phone becomes barely usable after 2 years and 2 major miui (hyos now but with same poor ram management problem) updates. Btw Redmi note 13 4g with sd 685 works terrible on last hyos. Will r15 4g be better? Ofc bo. Reply","4.0","2025-08-24 00:00:00","GSM Arena","True","2025.0","8.0"

Front screen is really nice, clear an good brightness.  (just hate that underscreen camera) Big screen is nice, clear and good for reading emails, news and when having two apps open at same time. (hate underscreen camera and screen size does nothing for video) When I watch Netflix I prefer front screen as itÂ´s more clear and fits better movie size.  Also I can make phone stand like tent on table.  I donÂ´t get bigger video with tha aspect of big screen. All cameras are good.  Tried to use AI in darker area and works good but itÂ´s like use AI to create what is to dark, not real so I turn it off and pictures are still OK Fingerprint scaner in button I like, but itÂ´s not always accurate Battery seems to last ok compare to how small it is.  Cant go fully 2 days but then just charge j85% every day so itÂ´s fine. When I want to act quick and make photo, I hate that I donÂ´t have camera button to quick open camera. makes me 1 sec slower then on prevoius phone. Also I hate how much Samsung, Android uses to many Samsung apps when many Orginal Google are really good. New this before bought phone and know I donÂ´t need to use many of these Samsung. Think price on this phone is way to high, but as they give me Galaxy Buds3 Pro and Galaxy Watch Ultra with it it looked OK.  Samsung Galaxy Buds3 Pro are something I would not buy or recommend friends to buy.  Sound is nothing special, itÂ´s not hanging good enough in ear and quite away from the best in headsets like Bose and Sony so I already give it away.   This watch is mostly good, but probably they give away as itÂ´s have one big fault.  All these Samsung and Apple watches have to little time on battery, but because of some new sensors they needed to take away wirless charging option for that watch so you are always stuck with charing cable.  You canÂ´t top this watch up with your phone if itÂ´s low on battery as some other watches.  Battery last 2-3 days and takes around 2 hours to charge. Also I am not sure if I can use 2 Nano-SIM cards in mine.  think is just 1 slot, but then need eSIM.

The aftercare wasn't fab either as I had to send it back, wait for more than a month (but that's probably because I bought it in the Netherlands while living in Belgium and not having an official branch for that part of Europe) and when I finally got it back the problems were not solved. Nothing was done actually as I found out that the feedback was that there wasn't anything wrong. I had to send it back and create a list of all issues that I had and try to prove it wasn't ""user related"".

It's was what finally made me quit iPhones (for the most part, initially.) Xiaomi was put in the MET for F's sake, for the MIX line, that one time it was not ripping other companies' work off. I hated everything on MIUI, until I knocked loose something inside that made the screen go dark and I was forced to switch to a ""pure"" Pixel phone experience. The current Pixel experience. Oh boy, then I missed the invasive little thing like nothing else in the world, more than anything though, I missed the design. Because I might've hated it guts, but when it's wrapped in a beautiful, shiny, very f***ing slippery, ceramic shell, it kinda takes a bite out of MIUI worst traits. Can't say the same for Google's designs, they're boring, just as Google. Including Material Design and its iterations. Now that the Mix line jumped behind another car dragging empty cans on a string, whatever else is making noise, does Xiaomi has anything original? I'll just slip in a convenience denial for a bit, â€¦see if it's fixed in a few months. Reply","1.0","2025-08-16 00:00:00","GSM Arena","True","2025.0","8.0"

Everything rolls smooth so far - the OS, the change between the apps, etc. It's pretty quick with everything and I haven't encountered any lags. The build quality gives you the feeling that you hold something more expensive and the colour of it makes the phone pretty beautiful (Grey mist). It comes with pre installed radio app, which you have to enable it in Play Store. The music coming out of the earphones connected to the 3.5 jack port is very clear with so many choices to select due to Dolby Atmos app. Battery lasts 2 days with full use, even though the battery is still ""learning"" my pattern use.

The Display is excellent, but it has a 27% higher resolution @ 1220 x 2712 pixels than the 1080 x 2400 pixels (Stylus 2024). For all those wondering why the battery life is not as amazing as the Stylus 2024. Here is your answer, an unneeded/unnoticeable increase in resolution.

Maybe Vivo has an oversupply of UFS 2.2 storage chips that's why they are still using them at 2025. Reply","3.0","2025-08-13 00:00:00","GSM Arena","True","2025.0","8.0"

There's a very good reason why Sony put back the 3.5mm audio jack on the 2020 Xperia 1 II after two years of removing it from their flagship smartphones, and not just because of better audio quality.

Couldn't you atleast make the mobile more sturdy especially when it's so small. A smaller and lighter device ought to be more durable. And after your sister companies have been using batteries with 1600 or i think some models with even 1800 hundred charge cycles, you give it a battery with only 800 charge cycles, that's pathetic and Vivo has been getting worse since it's started to sell well. You'll meet the same fate as Xiaomi jf you keep it up. And so much for your special phone glass, what a joke. I can accept the repairability score being bad since the phone is very small and thus tend to have space limitations, naturally. However, how much more the ufs 4 storage would have cost, 5 bucks maybe. This is expected from a company still using ufs 2.2 storage, lpddr 4x ram and the trash of Qualcomm, Snadragon 7 gen 3 and 7 gen 4 in Vivo v50 and upcoming Vivo V60 respectively, it's upper mid range phones, they are trash now but used to be good.

This take *could* be acceptable now that other companies are implementing silicon carbide batteries and Samsung hasn't, but Samsung still manufactures phones with great batteries. Now, are they good compared to other companies? Not really. However, when you consider that Galaxy flagships (the S24 Ultra and S25 Ultra) are easily 2-day battery phones with 4-5 hour screen on time, you start to realize that Samsung still makes capable phones with proper batteries. Now, I'm not sure if the Fold7 in particular has a greater battery life than the Fold6, or is even remotely acceptable to be considered a game-changing foldable in the now diverse industry since I haven't checked the battery tests on the Fold7. However, what I can tell you is that I've watched reviews of the Fold6, and it lags lightly behind the S24 Ultra in terms of battery life, which is understandable since the Fold6 is a 4400mAh battery while the S24 Ultra is a 5000mAh with a single 6.8 inch screen. In short, calling Samsung a master of poor battery life is simply inaccurate. What *is* correct, however, is that Samsung is currently facing a period where they're lagging behind competitors in terms of battery life; not necessarily meaning they're bad at battery management. OnePlus had a phase (OP 10 to OP 12-ish period) where they too were lagging behind the competition. However, as of right now, OnePlus seems to be dominating the landscape along with Oppo with their latest OnePlus 13. TL;DR: This take is pretty bad. Samsung may not be implementing industry-leading batteries right now, but that doesn't mean they're not implementing good batteries on their devices.

It makes sense for them to be skeptical of the new silicon carbide technologies. Although, I could be wrong. These are why I think they're not implementing silicon carbide batteries: 1. Playing it safe: The Note7 left a scar on them. 2. Relatively new: It's a new technology in the Smartphone world, so they're waiting to see if it passes all the bells and whistles of a safe Smartphone. Although, this theory is the one that disappoints me the most, considering back in the 2010s, Samsung were the pioneers of new technology. 3. It's expensive: Since it's a new technology, Samsung may wait for R&D to bring the production cost down. They already know that their flagships cost in the range of $1300 (which is still, unfortunately, more expensive than Apple's $1200 for the iPhone 16 Pro Max). If they implement silicon carbide batteries in say, the S26 lineup, they may have to cut costs somewhere (maybe a further S-pen nerf) to keep the price at $1300.

"REV_002071","USER_ANON_01711","Galaxy Z Fold7","Samsung","B Betuvsky 8va 28 Jul 2025 Hey, this foldable is really worth it! So here it is! The Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 is out and, honestly, itâ€™s quite a blast. It was officially released on July 25, 2025, so if youâ€™re a fan of foldable phones, you can now check it out. Design and feel in hand: The first thing thatâ€™ll hit you is how much thinner and lighter itâ€™s become. Seriously, the Fold 7 is now much slimmer and more comfortable to carry than previous models. Samsung claims 8.9 mm thickness, but in reality, itâ€™s even thinner â€“ just 8.82 mm. And the hinge? Itâ€™s been improved â€“ itâ€™s sturdier, and the crease on the inner screen is less noticeable. Best of all, the external cover screen is wider (6.5 inches, 21:9 aspect ratio), making it much more usable for everyday tasks without needing to unfold the phone constantly. Plus, itâ€™s got an IP48 certification, meaning itâ€™s more resistant to water and dust. Nice! Displays â€“ a feast for the eyes: Unfold it and youâ€™re greeted with a stunning 8.0-inch AMOLED display. The resolution is 2184 x 1968 pixels and it supports an adaptive refresh rate ranging from 1 to 120 Hz â€“ everything looks super smooth and crisp. The outer display has a resolution of 2520 x 1080 pixels. Both screens are bright, detailed, and ideal for multitasking, watching content, or gaming. Truly a joy to look at! Performance under the hood: Inside, itâ€™s powered by the latest Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy processor. This beast ensures the phone flies, no matter how many apps you open or what demanding games you play. With improved AI features, the Fold 7 is optimized for smart interactions and enhanced experiences with AI tools like Gemini Live. Multitasking on this phone is just a dream â€“ you can switch between apps seamlessly with zero lag. Cameras â€“ now thatâ€™s the big deal! This is where major upgrades happened. The Galaxy Z Fold 7 boasts a 200MP main camera (compared to the 50MP on the Fold 6), along with a 12MP ultra-wide lens and a 10MP telephoto lens. This means your photos will be far more detailed and high quality. There are also new AI photo editing tools, like â€œSuggested Erasesâ€, which automatically remove unwanted objects from the background. The front camera on the cover screen is 10MP. Battery and charging: The battery keeps the same capacity as the Fold 6 â€“ 4400 mAh, but Samsung promises longer battery life â€“ up to 24 hours on a single charge. It supports 25W wired charging, 15W wireless, and 4.5W reverse wireless charging. Software: The phone runs on Android 16 with One UI 8, specifically optimized for the foldable format, offering features for multi-screen use. And the best part â€“ Samsung promises up to 7 major software updates, which is fantastic for long-term support. Price and availability: The Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 starts at $1,999.99 (in the Czech Republic, the price will likely start around CZK 50,000 or more, depending on the configuration). Yes, itâ€™s expensive, but considering what it offers, for tech enthusiasts, every penny is worth it. In conclusion: The Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 is without a doubt an impressive piece of hardware that pushes the boundaries of foldable phones. Its thinner and lighter design, amazing displays, flagship performance, and huge camera upgrade make it a very appealing choice for those looking for the ultimate foldable experience. Despite the high price, it represents a significant step forward in foldable smartphone technology. Hope you liked this more casual review!

I don't want a huge camera bump they would better design it one side a bit thicker with no camera bump and the folding side thinner... The camera bump takes thinness to absurd extremes. If the camera bump is thicker than the phone itself, the device wobbles back and forth when placed on a table, making it virtually unusable. There could hardly be a more stupid design.

Im afraid of them saying its within the industrial standard and there is no replacement. So i will list down the problem just in case: 1. Recent task will cause flickering - when brightness level set to just slightly above the sun logo 2. Going to apps folders will cause flickering - when brightness level set to just slightly above the sun logo. 3. Enable 'disable permission monitoring' (in case wanna use wireless debugging) will cause crazy flickering blinking + auto dim every 3 seconds or so when you're reading something (like from Whatsapp, telegram, reddit etc.) 4. Flicking whenever pull notification bar. 5. Storage read/write is way too slow. Mine (43.8GB used out of 512GB) 6. read/write for SD card is too ridiculous, hardly able to read if you have alot of music/photos in a folder unless you have ample of time to wait. (Mine 61.4GB used out of 512GB). I believe with software update can help fix a thing or two here. So OPPO please do something about it.

Android is the best software thats no doubt the only reason why android is not good is because of the OEM itself,they dont invest thier time fixing their own iteration of android,unlike samsung.

The charging speed is faster (at less than 40 minutes from 0-100) and not at GSM Arena's 90 minutes. 2.	The mono speaker is super loud, but has no bass. 3.	Fall resistance is real. I deliberately threw it from a 2-storey building onto an interlock floor without a pouch, and it survived the fall without a scratch or a dent. 4.	I left it a bucket of water from 8p.m. till 9a.m. (25 hours), and battery didn't go down, and the phone is not damaged. 5.	The battery life was superb when I first got it. 6.	I don't play games on phones. So I don't know anything about its game-playing ability. 7.	When it's used to snap documents, it's very sharp. 8.	The call quality is good. 9.	The phone is loud during calls, even in a noisy environment, but I donâ€™t know if itâ€™s noise-cancellation ready. 10.	It doesnâ€™t get hot even in an extreme 45â° C. condition. Cons 1.	The camera production is weak. Pictures look sharper when taken, but grainy when you zoom in. 2.	The battery drains faster within 3 hours from 100 to 40% in extreme social media usage if itâ€™s not set to power saving mode after a â€¦930 software update. But it endures from 40 to 3% for more than  8 hours. 3.	Front-facing camera is useless in a lowlight condition. I love the phone, but I'm still missing my Huawei P30 Pro and Samsung A33.

It's stays mostly cool via charging and i think this is what it's helping it the most. Battery is impressive, never used Pixel beside in-store test so i have no idea what the battery could be, but i'm using the 16 PM and the battery backup is verry good, 2-day battery without gaming - no problems, not at all. Fast charging also. I have no idea what kind of magic Apple did to the charging and why it's rated so low, while in reality is comparable with Android's rivals but you have to buy it to see it. On paper it's weak while acutally it's not. I'm coming from Xiaomi with 90W and charging is mostly comparable, very rapid till 80%. Xiaomi has faster start but then runs hotter. This one it a bit slower yet cooler and has prolonged fast charging. The A18 Pro is very cold chip. Reply","4.0","2025-07-23 00:00:00","GSM Arena","True","2025.0","7.0"

There was a bit more chance of that when the SD 8 Elite was initially announced all device would have UWB by default, then Qualcomm clarified IHVs/mfrs could opt not to implement it, so likely still would've been missing if Samsung went with SD 8E instead, just like they kept it off Flip 6, 5, 4 but had it on Folds. Annoying for anyone with Samsung's own SmartTag2 , as a result I won't recommend them anymore until that changes (go 3rd party if you lose UwB anyways, thus gain iOS). All current iPhones have it, even the entry level, and have had for a while, so it makes no sense to not be on a flagship Flip not ALL of the S series cheaping out on the regular S25. ðŸ¤¬ PS, needs to be said, especially here, not promoting Apple, just F'in annoyed yet another Flip doesn't have UWB! ðŸ˜¡ Reply","4.0","2025-07-16 00:00:00","GSM Arena","True","2025.0","7.0"

By now you should've known that was a possibility after it being leaked over 3 months ago (and F7FE using E2400 leak at beginning of year) , plus Flip7 E2500 benchmarks leaking over a month ago.. We'll have to see how much of a difference it makes, especially for battery & thermals more so than benchmark performance. I would prefer an SD8 Elite over an Exynos on principal, but not if they cripple everything that makes it better. Just look at the Moto 60 Ultra's performance numbers in the review here, it loses to Flip 6 AND 50 Ultra's weaker SD8S G3 in Geekbench single core,  ties the Flip6 in multi-core and is far FAR from the Xiaomi 15 in ALL tests despite having 4GB more RAM ! It also throttled almost immediately and couldn't even finish GSMA's GPU stress test. What's the point in that, other than paying extra for a chip you can't even use? If they had to cripple the SD 8E to get it to work in the Flip7 like they did the Moto, or even the SD 8G3 in Flip6 (no WiFi 7, No Dex, No UWB), then what's the point? For most people Exynos 2500 with Dex and other minor features beats a heavily throttled SD8E. The biggest question mark (other than the claimed/supposed fixed battery/thermals Exynos problems) is likely can the E2500 do all the Ai / OS / UI tasks that the SD8E devices can, that's more likely to be the make/break point rather than a few points/fps difference on a benchmark, and somewhere where the extra 4GB should theoretically make a difference. Still wish it had UWB and camera upgrades to the two leftovers from the original Z Flip, and improved charging of course, but personally care less about charging than the others. LTPO cover would have also been nice, but 120hz is a step in the right direction at least. Reply","4.0","2025-07-11 00:00:00","GSM Arena","True","2025.0","7.0"

"REV_002655","USER_ANON_01800","Galaxy Watch8 Classic","Samsung","U Ugou DM6 09 Jul 2025 Samsung's innovation is now apparently questionable. They take one step forward, two steps backward. After adding additional sensors(ie bioactive, blood oxygen , etc) they reduced the screen size , put up a mediocre old-gen battery tech when we now have new-gen battery tech like the lithium-silicone battery that could easily make them bump the battery capacity from the current 445mah to 500mah while still maintaining the sleek look of the watch, old-gen Bluetooth version 5.3 when Bluetooth 6.1 is out already.... I can go on and on. The Samsung of now isn't the Samsung we used to know about a decade ago. They used to be the pioneers in these sort of things, I guess corporate greed has gotten a hold of them, all they care about is the most profit they can salvage off of consumers. About time they step up their game. Otherwise, they'll be left in the dust to these Chinese OEMs innovating aggressively. They're in the decline anyway. Let's see how the next decade turns out for themâ€” if they continue in this selfish trajectory, they'll sure be stuggling to get a grip of the saturated smartphone/watch market share like Sony is currently. A hard pass for me anyway. Sticking to my 6Classic. Reply","","2025-07-09 00:00:00","GSM Arena","False","2025.0","7.0"

All of our debit, credit cards are ... more you are the one living under a rock, basic UPI payments gained traction around 2020 and became the norm in 2023. As for NFC, it has been limited to the richer tier 1 cities and at most used in the shopping hubs in tier 2. Phones in India rarely come with NFC at the sub 20k range because the market simply doesn't have the need. This is changing fast though, most of the 2025 releases have NFC and NFC payments are being tried at some mid tier shops. To say that, NFC is used widely in India is just plain stupid. If you earn 30k per month, you are earing more money than 80% of the population (850 million people), and I don't think NFC payments are a primary concern for any of them. NFC has been seen as the ""rich dude payment method"" for decades at this point. NFC can only be said to be widespread once the t2 city rural area vegetable vendor starts accepting NFC payments.

I think even before Samsung smartphones existed it would be pretty easy to find a house with a Samsung product (fridge, TV, washing machine, microwave, DVD player etc) huawei on the other hand was largely an unknown brand outside of China until the android era. Lifting sanctions against huawei is something I want but wanting to stop sales of Samsung phones makes no sense when America's relationship with south Korea is a lot less tense than its relationship with China. Huaweis presence in the android market definitely helped people trust them more but Samsung already had a headstart due to them already being well known much like Apple. Chinese brands should be more popular but a lot of them don't put in any real effort outside of China and India. Reply","5.0","2025-07-07 00:00:00","GSM Arena","True","2025.0","7.0"

While I am bummed, the list of clamshells with both a telephoto and an ultrawide is just two: the Oppo Find N3 Flip and the Huawei Pocket 2, or three if you count the Huawei Pura X. There are other options with a telephoto including the Xiaomi Mix Flip and Motorola Razr 50 Ultra/Razr+ (2024/2025), but they both lack the ultrawide camera. And besides, all the telephoto cameras on clamshells (besides Huawei) are 2x optical zoom anyway, and Huawei's clamshell telephotos are a measly 8MP in resolution (3x optical zoom for the Pocket 2, 3.5x for the Pura X).

"REV_003247","USER_ANON_02065","Galaxy Tab S10 FE+","Samsung","G Ghostwolf87 raN 14 Jun 2025 I have had this tablet for a month now as a replacement for my 2020 S6 Lite. This is a great tablet.  Battery last me two days of solid use in note taking, YT and Netflix watching, and Kindle and Manga reading. It multi tasks just fine for me, with Vivaldi browser and Writing app for note taking running side by side. I donâ€™t need it to game.  That is what my desktop PC or laptop running Linux is for.  This tablet goes to work every day with me and gets used daily. Putting a matte film screen protector didnâ€™t degrade image quality or colors, at least to my eyes.  It makes using it under the lights at work, and outside, much easier. So if you are looking for an economical tablet with a great screen and good battery life, plus having like 6 or 7 years of promised updates from Samsung, it will be hard to beat this. Are there higher speced devices from the Chinese manufacturers?  Sure, but they will be e-waste in two or three years if not sooner when software support stops.  At least Samsung is backing their devices for the long term. Reply","4.0","2025-06-14 00:00:00","GSM Arena","True","2025.0","6.0"

I needed a spare phone and since I'm tired of Xiaomi and their software, I decided to give it a try. - It does have both NFC and a hybrid SIM slot that can take a micro SD card. - Build quality seems good, screen is decent, it has HDR, PWM implementation isn't the best in this one but it isn't terrible. - Battery life is very good... I charged it to 100%, 26 hours ago, and after 7 hours of SoT I still have 53% battery left. Overnight drain is very frugal, very efficient chipset here, and it also performs nicely. Haven't tested many games but it does the job as long as you don't expect the best graphics. - Selfie cam is good, main cam is also good under well lit conditions. It shows its weaknesses when the lights go down, but it was to be expected. Still reliable for most of the stuff you need. - Software wise, very stable, optimized, up to date security patches and stuff. Overall, quite surprised with this phone. For the price I paid, better deal vs the Redmi Note 14 Pro 5G, Samsung A36 or Moto Edge 60 Fusion, all of them are over 330 USD here.

"REV_003564","USER_ANON_00338","Pad 2","Pad","X XenoMagami In{ 28 May 2025 I bought one of these earlier this year. Performance wise, it's fantastic; snapdragon 8 gen 3 with a 3K 12"" display, 12GB of RAM? For 600 dollars? Sign me up. Speakers sound great, and mine came with the pen. General use is silky smooth, that SOC plus the display make the navigation seamless. no lag whatsoever when browsing menus even with a decent amount of background apps open. Any game you want to play will run flawlessly, and has enough power for more demanding applications. Downsides; 3:2 aspect ratio means most videos are going to be cropped. Accessory support isn't there, and the fact that they made this an updated model of an existing ""Pad 2"" means that you have to specifically look for cases and screen protectors built for the 12.1"" model instead of the 11"" version from 2023. Only cases available are folding cases or flimsy silicone bumpers that offer no structural support so if it's dropped it'll still likely shatter the screen, and they don't offer cases with a storage space for the pen to charge. Camera could be better but it's not bad. If you plan to use this for a car, surprise, it has no built in GPS so you'll need to find some way to share location data from your phone to the tablet. If you can get past the downsides, it's a great device for using at home for general use or even as a drawing tablet with the pen. Unless someone can make a multilayer case I wouldn't trust myself taking this device around in public and I definitely wouldn't trust it around younger users because there's no good way to protect it from drop damage as of yet.

In these case if s25 can keep up with iPhone then for sure android is better. Most of the people focuses on camera then itâ€™s win to win for both ï£¿ and Samsung.TBH There are better camera phones than these two. Consider vivo x200 ultra or Xiaomi 15 ultra. They both leading not only in camera but also in software and performance.

The manual also mentions that headphones need to be USB-C type. That makes the XCover7 Pro the first XCover phone without a headphone jack. I hope the new larger-capacity battery is backwards compatible with the older XCover6 Pro, as that would mean there is at least something useful with this release.

I don't think there is much of a plan behind that feature, it is more a matter of whether the phone happens to have the tech to make it work. I.e. if there is FM integrated in the SoC and a headphone jack to serve as an antenna, then the manufacturer can simply ""unlock"" the functionality. Old chipsets usually had FM and XCovers had audio jacks, so they got the radio. But most modern phones no longer have the audio jack, so chipsets have been dropping the FM because few phones can have the antenna to use it, hence modern phones tend to lack at least one condition to get FM. Samsung kept FM around longer in their Exynos SoCs, so the XCover Pro and FieldPro both have FM radios. But the XCover6 Pro switched to Qualcomm 778G, which does not come with FM, so no radio despite the antenna. And the XCover7 Pro seems to lack both the FM and the antenna.

You know when chipset produced not all yields good results. Some outputs are expected and the rest are ""least"" expected.

You can google ""SoC Binning"" or ""Chipset binning"" for detailed info. Relate that with Apple's conserving policies then it would be more make sense why they dont want simply put binned chips to trash. Just like what they did on binned A17 Pro inside Mini 7 iPad.

"REV_004229","USER_JSO_02273538","iPhone 16 Pro","Apple","NI9 05 Apr 2025 I got this phone as a work phone through my company. It's a great phone, but its freaking heavy. A phone with a 6.3 inch screen and it weights almost 200 grams! That's the problem with iPhones, especially compared to a Samsung of similar size. Samsung phones are much lighter and easier to carry, especially in the pocket. For reference, the much smaller 16 Pro even weighs more than the Galaxy S25 plus. The S25 plus has a 6.7 inch screen and only weighs 190 grams. The camera island on the 16 pro is one of the major reasons. Its massive, and it protrudes so much that it looks ridiculous. If you sit it down flat on a table, it wobbles like crazy. I decided to just use the iPhone 12 for work. It's the smallest iPhone they've made in recent years (aside from the mini's), and it only weighs about 164 Grams. It's easy to use one handed and it doesn't bulge in your pocket or feel like a brick. The 16 Pro is a much more superb phone, but they made it too big and too heavy.

My last one was iPhone 12 mini that had a terrible battery and I've decided to move to Android plattform, looking for greater battery/screen but I regreted doing this, terrible mistake. Android phones are cheap but you also get a cheaper experience, awful cameras, systemwide Google annoyances, unsafe environment, etc. The list of disadvantages goes far as I can enlist them. So, I moved back to iPhone and decided to get premium one. It's a night and day difference, the camera is so damn great and using iOS is so nice and smooth. Everything just works out of the box, no hacking and messing with external apps. You don't need to dowload Gcam apk, you don't need to rely on custom apps, fix this and fix that. I'm very happy with my purchase and I'll never consider an Android phone again. Google also lost me as consumer as I moved to Bing search engjne and even deleted my account.

Apple's app store is WAY more vetted than Android and the play store is... did I say that right??? :) I was initially Apple when it came to smart devices and went to Android shortly after. I stayed Android for about 6 years and went back to Apple due to the lagging.

Anonymous CbG 25 Dec 2024 As a marine engineer from India, I am torn between three devices for my online studies, content consumption, and trading activities: the Samsung Galaxy S10 Ultra, Apple iPad Air M2, and iPad Pro M4. I currently use an iPhone 15 Pro Max and am seeking a device that will seamlessly integrate with my existing ecosystem. The devices' prices are as follows: - Samsung Galaxy S10 Ultra (base model): â‚¹79,000 with 1 year of free accidental damage coverage - Apple iPad Air M2: â‚¹75,000 (without Apple Pencil or Apple Care+) - Apple iPad Pro M4: â‚¹1,19,000(without Apple Pencil or Apple Care+) Key considerations for my purchase decision include: 1. *Future-proofing*: Will the Samsung Galaxy S10 Ultra's processor be sufficient for the next 7 years, considering the promised 7 years of OS updates? Similarly, how will the iPad Air M2 and iPad Pro M4 hold up in the future? 2. *Upcoming releases*: Should I wait for the rumored new iPad Air with M3 processor, expected in early 2025, which may come with a free Apple Pencil Pro? 3. *Additional costs*: Galaxy Al will become a chargeable service from 2026. What are the potential costs associated with each device, including repair costs? 4. *Ecosystem integration*: As an iPhone user, I value seamless integration with my existing Apple devices. Or should I switch to samsung galaxy tab just for studies? Considering my requirements and the factors mentioned above, I would appreciate your expert guidance on choosing the ideal device for my needs.

I'm gonna replace my iPad Pro 10.5 2017 with this. Timing is great, as it was the first Apple tablet with 120hz refresh rate, and this is the first with OLED screen. And Apple ended updates for it this year, and battery is going bad. I want the larger screen, and I still prefer 4:3 aspect ratio to others. If I want to watch videos in a bigger screen, I can use monitors or TV's. Actually I just want it to be large in both dimensions. Samsung Ultra also is (12.9"" in 4:3 window), but resolution is much lower. Also lower resolution overall. Not going into other specs now. I gave tablets points with my own system, S10+ got 5, S10 Ultra got 6 and iPad Pro 13 got 7 :() Also I don't use tablets for ""work"", full size PC is for that. Also no need for a laptop.

However, for me, thanks god we still has Android which offer true freedom rather than fall deep into Apple product which geared towards proprietary. Pricing and specs don't really speak about real experience. Yes, I prefer Android more for a reason, but not mean Apple product is bad, just that they are not as flexible. Also Apple side is all about spending more, getting more, but not guarantee work for more, they lock something for their own good. Android side is all about own choice, you can customized your choice, not really need to follow mainstream, yet still not far away from flagship experience, but really cost effective.

Where is your Basis that UFS 4.0 is twice Faster than the NVME on the 17 Pro Max? You keep mentioning the Pro but not the Pro Max. You think this year's iPhone 17 Pro Max will have the Same RAM FREQUENCY as the LAST YEAR'S iPhone 16 Pro Max? You're telling People about the tech cost. But you forgot to mentioned that Apple Pays the Devs. Big! Which is why there's so many apps being made Exclusively on iOS. Yes, android is Cheap. And you can get a 12GB RAM/512GB Android Phone like $200 or less. But Android doesn't pay the Devs. BIG. Which is why when iOS gets a AAA games like the Hitman World of Assassination, Assassins Creed Mirage, Sniper Elite 4, then by Q1 2026 Sniper Elite 5,  Death Stranding, and many more. You keep asking. When it will come to Android. And if you think Emulation Solves the Problem? Google just declared that by 2026. Sideloading will be Banned. Turning Android into a WALLED GARDEN like the iOS. Reply","3.85","","GSM Arena","True","",""

Also Apple side is all about spending more, getting more, but not guarantee work for more, they lock something for their own good.
